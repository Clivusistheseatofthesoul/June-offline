## Clinical features:
### Can start as [[Alexia without agraphia]] or even 'Musical alexia'
### [[Simultanagnosia]] with gradual progression to global [[Agnosias]] -> specifically starting as visual agnosias
#### They lose the 'gestalt' of things E.g 8 is no longer 8, but '8 ones' -> they lose the inherent individual '8-ness'
### Gradual simplification of object concepts -> unable to recognise objects that are increasingly simple 
#### Can start just at extremely complex objects they are personally experts at recognising E.g Musicians will lose ability to 'sight-read' before loss of words
### They do well in controlled scenarios here they remember where everything is -> by developing ingenious ways of organising things 
#### They do worst when things look alike
#### They do worst in unknown scenarios where locations of things are not remembered
### Preserved elemental perception even till the end
#### **Colour**, shape, contrast and movement 
#### Auditory information becomes hyperattended to and take up increasing importance in identifying things
### Preserved insight, personality, memory and intelligence
#### They know what is happening to them 
### Sometimes associated features:
#### [[Gerstmann's Syndrome]], [[Colour anomia]]

## DDx:
### Typically from alzhiemer disease

# Tx
## Need to find strategies for organising things 
## Emphasise the importance of sound and touch
## Their visual paralysis is completely localised to perception -> but their visual memory will be super-charged
## New areas will become very difficult 
## Word-finding will becoming slowly and gradually more difficult -> but they will be able to 'circumscribe'
