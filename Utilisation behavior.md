![[Utilisation behavior v2.mp4]]
> Caption: Utilization behavior: butterfly glioma. The patient puts on a pair of glasses when offered them and then a second and third pair, stacking one upon the other. He persists with doing this, even though it is difficult to get them all in place. When offered a hat, he fiddles with it, checks the label, and then puts it on. He puts a second and third hat on top of the first. He appears to lack emotion. When offered a banana he peels and starts to eat it but then puts it down admitting that he is not hungry
