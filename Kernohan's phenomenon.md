# Unique and false localising sign where ipsilateral lesion (from uncal hernation) results in **ipsilateral** body weakness -> full paralysis in conjunction with ipsilateral fixed blown pupil

## Includes:
## Ipsilateral [[Weakness]], Ipsilateral [[Unilateral blown pupil]]
## Part of:
## [[Uncal herniation syndrome]]

---
Mechanism: Uncal herniation around the medial side of the tentorium cerebelli -> compression of the #contralateral #cerebral_peduncle and dorsal superficial most aspect of 1st segement of #CN_III -> hence unilateral fixed blown pupil before full 3rd nerve palsy
- As the midbrain is further displaced, sometimes the #contralateral #cerebral_peduncle is forced against the tentorium edge, creating Kernohanâ€™s notch and damaging contralateral corticospinal tract, thereby resulting in paresis ipsilateral to the mass lesion
Seen in: #Neuro #Emergent

It is important to note generally: **==if the pupil is affected the cause is surgical (i.e. compressive); and if spared, the cause is more likely to be medical (diabetes, cranial arteritis, arteriosclerosis, meningovascular syphilis or, particularly in the younger age groups, migraine)==**
