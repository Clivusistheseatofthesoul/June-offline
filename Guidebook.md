The aim of this database is to provide a resource which can filter based on 2 things: The origin of disease, and the language of medicine 
- these are 2 different concepts and are inaptly taught confusingly together during medical school.
- This database has the ability to segregate between the two -> use that to inform your schema of both how disease manifests, and what you call it such that other people can understand you 

## 1. Pathogenesis of disease
- Clinical features: Things that you actually see and make note of which are manifestations of specific diseases listed within the page 
	1. Symptom
	2. Sign
	3. Syndrome 
- Clinical features may have linked semiotics 
- Diseases: Disease entities which are indexed by their pathogenesis not by semiotics (See [[Guidebook#Language of clinical medicine]])

## Language of clinical medicine
### Learning the language of medicine is crucially important but
### where medical terminology comes from and what the words mean often do not reflect the 'why' and 'how' aspects of disease I.e Clinical terminology does not always reflect aetiology
- Clinical Semiotics: Categories of clinical signs which may not have any general relation to specific disease but are pages present anyway to help navigate and understand how clinical language is derived ^Semiotics
- Disease Semiotics: Categories of diseases (oftentimes pathological classifications) which may not have any general relationship to pathogenesis but do have commonalities either pathologically or in their pathophysiological disease process 
	- Remove semiotics from graph if you want a pathogenetically oriented search 

## *Augenblickdiagnose*
### German for "Diagnosis in the blink of an eye"
### Findings or phenomenon so characteristic that the differential diagnosis is essentially limited to one possibility


## Using consistent terminology 
Consistent terminology is required to maintain ease of search. Whilst Pages have aliases, tags and elements within pages do not. Even with page aliases, I don't have the patience, time to research them nor spelling ability to get search terms correct on the first try
