# Abscence of either bilateral or unilateral blink in response to stimulation of the cornea with a wisp of cotton
## Description:
### Ensure to ask the patient if they felt the cotton wool afterwards -> some are very stoical and refuse to blink!
## Part of:
### [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]]
## DDx:

### Dx by exclusion -> [[Bell's palsy]]

Mechanism:  Destructive lesion to the pathway of the corneal reflex
- #CN_V1 -> common #CN_V -> #CN_V_principle_sensory_nucleus + #CN_V_spinal_nucleus ->  bilateral #facial_nucleus -> fibres loop around #facial_colliculus -> #CN_VII -> #orbicularis_oculi
Generally divided into either afferent branch or efferent branch defects
- Afferent defect → destructive lesion of CNV1 → no signal ever reaches the bilateral facial nuclei
- Efferent defect → destructive lesion of CNVII → blink action cannot propogate to the ipsilateral orbicularis oculi

Seen in: #Neuro

When elliciting -> ask them to look up and medially, hold down the lower eye lid and lightly rubb the marked area ensuring not to cross into the pupil (patient will see the wisp and blink)
