# Combined cranial nerve palsies of those that traverse the cavernous sinus
## Includes:
### Complaint of [[Diplopia]]
#### Combination of unilateral partial or total opthalmoplegia:
##### [[Abducens palsy]] is the earliest in thrombosis
##### [[Oculomotor palsy]] is the earliest in mass lesions and aneurysmal compression
##### [[Trochlear palsy]] is the earliest in mass lesions
### The type of cavernous sinus syndrome is clinically determined by the degree of C.N V involvement:
#### Entire [[Trigeminal palsy]] -> Posterior cavernous sinus syndrome
#### [[Trigeminal Opthalmic palsy]] and [[Trigeminal maxillary palsy]] -> [[Corneal reflex (absent)]], but normal jaw muscles -> Middle cavernous sinus syndrome
#### Isolated [[Trigeminal Opthalmic palsy]] -> Anterior cavernous sinus syndrome
### Sometimes [[Horner's Syndrome]] -> myosis, ptosis sometimes with apparent exopthalmos 
## DDx:
### [[Cavernous sinus thrombosis]] either [[Aseptic venous sinus thrombosis]] or [[Septic venous sinus thrombosis]]
### Mass lesion
#### Sellar mass lesions -> large [[Pituitary macroadenoma]] can expand laterally 
#### Intracranial aneurysms -> specifically [[Intracavernous aneurysm - anterior type]] and [[Intercavernous aneurysm - posterior type]]
#### [[Meningiomas]] of the sphenoid wing
####  Chordomas of the basi sphenoid may extend up into the pituitary fossa or laterally into both cavernous sinuses
####  Craniopharyngiomas may behave similarly from above and behind
#### Local extension of carcinoma of the nasopharynx 
### By exclusion -> [[Tolosa Hunt Syndrome]]

**Mechanism:** Close proximity of nerves to vascular structures, sinuses, and the sella turcica result in multiple aetiologies converging at the lateral wall of the #cavernous_sinus to present as cavernous sinus syndrome
- Mass lesions -> esp. pituitary chemophobe adenomas can spread laterally -> impinging on CN III first

- Intercavernous seegment carotid artery aneurysms (of the anterior type) -> impinge CN III and IV first
