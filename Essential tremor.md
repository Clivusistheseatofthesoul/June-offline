Aliases: Familial physiologic tremor
---
# Rhythmic kinetic [[Tremor]] of 8-12Hz worst on skilled movement 
## Clinical features: Isolated tremor 
### [[Kinetic tremor]] which is a particularly debilitating variant of physiological tremor -> worst when doing voluntary skilled movements and oftentimes gets worse with old age 
#### Mean onset age -> 45 y/o
#### Report peas falling out of spoon, spilling coffee before it gets to mouth
#### Will be obvious when getting them to act out the motion, handwriting, drawing a spiral etc
### Can be associated with a [[Vocal tremor]] and a [[Head tremor]]
#### Sometimes there can be minor [[Broad-based gait]]
### Tremor improves with alcohol, gets worse with [[Caffeine]] and stress, alcohol withdrawal
### Often report a FHx of similar tremor 
## DDx:
### Half of the time will be genetic
### Other half:
#### [[Thyrotoxicosis|Hyperthyroidism]], other causes of increased adrenergic activity 
#### [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome]]
## Mimics:
### Wilson's disease 
## Workup: Clinical diagnosis with associated labs if suspecting non-genetic cause
### Blood pressure -> if you're considering beta-blocker as treatment
### labs are for ruling out medical causes
#### TSH, Ceruloplasmic
---
# Tx
## Treat medical cause
## Lifestyle changes
### Reduction of adrenergic activity -> reduced caffiene, better sleep hygiene 
## Beta blockers, primidone, or topiramate  for severe cases 
### Avoid in older patients, choose based on BP and asthma history

## Complications

## Aetiology
### Inherited autosomal dominant unknown allele

#### Cases
Mr X is a 65yo R.H male who has presented with gradual worsening of a bilateral tremor of ~20 years. Initial onset is unknown, the tremor is present in both hands and has progressively worsened over the years such that he can no longer write, or drink from a cup. he states that the right hand is worse than the left. The tremor has never been present when resting. Drinking alcohol dampens the tremor. His mother and duaghter have a similar tremor. Mr X was seen at the end of the bed. On examiantion, the tremor was not present at rest. His voice is trembly. There is a bilateral 8Hz tremor in the arms that is most prominent with full extension of arms outwards. The amplitude of the tremor did not increase with finger to nose testing. Occasional tremor was noted of his head.  The remainder of the exam produced no remarkable findings. 
- In summary, Mr X a 65y/o R.H male presents with progressive worsening of a bilateral hand kinetic tremor and exacerbated by voluntary skilled movement on a significant family history of similar tremor. Prescence of vocal tremor, lack of resting tremor and response with alcohol point towards this being an essential tremor.
