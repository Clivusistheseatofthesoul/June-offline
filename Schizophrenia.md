# 
## Clinical features:
### Onset of first [[Psychosis|Psychotic break]] around young age precipitated by a stressor
#### Typically when they first leave home 
### Duration of 'odd behavior and speech' which narrows from psychosis ddx, and r/o schizophrenia mimics -> [[Schneiderian first rank symptoms]] and [[Schneiderian second rank symptoms]]
|          | [[Brief psychotic disorder]] | [[Schizophreniform disorder]] | [[Schizophrenia]]        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Duration | 1 day - 1 month              | 1 month - 6 months            | > 6 months               |
| Tx       | 1 month of anti-psychotics   | 3-6 months of anti-psychotics | Lifelong anti=psychotics |  
#### Schizophrenia has psychosis which persists for > 6 months (and lifelong if not treated)
##### 6 months starting from onset of any prodrome (dosen't have to be formal psychosis)
##### This is not like PTSD where if you intervened earlier you could prevent it -> there is no therapy that we have which overcomes the neurodevelopmental predisposition
### Presence of disordered mood

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | --- |
| Severeity of mood features | Not enough to meet criteria for  [[Depressive mood]] or [[Mania]] | Mostly Psychosis with meeting criteria for mild [[Depressive mood]] or [[Mania]]       | Mostly [[Depressive mood]] or [[Mania]] with mild features [[Psychosis]] which does not have to meet critera | Nil [[Psychosis]] |     |
| Timing of mood features    | Nil                                                               | **Isolated psychotic episodes** which must be seperated from mood episodes by >2 weeks | Psychosis only happens sometimes during mood episodes, **never alone**                                       | Nil               |     |

### O/E
#### [[Overdressing for weather]] including [[Sunglasses inside]]

## DDx:
### Typical young onset
#### Small subset are associated with high-risk allele
##### [[DiGeorge syndrome]]
#### Most are polygenic interactions
### Can have [[Late onset schizophrenia]]
## Mimics:
### Neurological psychosis
#### 
### Other forms of delusions
#### Simple delusion disorder
### Continum with mood disorders
#### Schizoaffective disorder
#### Mood disorder with psychotic features
### Severe schizotypal personality disorder, severe paranoid personality disorder 
#### Schizotypal will have non-bizarre delusions and not have that much functional impairment (not complete disorganisation of speech and behavior etc)
#### Paranoid will mainly have abscence of perceptual alterations
## Workup:
### Clinical diagnosis
#### Must have 2/5 features of psychosis AND the combination must not just be 4 and 5
| Symptom group     | Symptoms                                                | Classical description                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive symptoms | Delusions                                               | [[Persecutory delusions]], [[Grandiose delusions]]                                    |
|                   | Hallucinations                                          | Almost always -> [[Auditory hallucinations]], [[Accussatory auditory hallucinations]] |
|                   | Disorganisation of speech aka 'Formal thought disorder' | [[Word salad]], [[Neologism]] with [[Derailment]] and/or incoherent speech            |
|                   | Disorganisation of behavior                             | Not cleaning room, or themselves, not doing ADLs OR [[Catatonia]]                     |
| Negative symptoms | 5As                                                     | [[Flat affect]], [[Alogia]] , [[Avolition]], [[Anhedonia]], impaired attention                                                                                        |
### Labs
#### Urine drug screen -> esp. if a college kid
### Imaging
#### CT-B to r/o organic aetiology
#### Schizophrenia can have certain changes even on CT
##### Chronic schizophrenia -> [[Ventriculomegaly|Lateral ventricular enlargement]] with frontal lobe cortical atrophy

---
# Acute Tx
## [[Anti-psychotics]] Â± [[Benzos]] if required 

# Secondary prevention
## Early intervention reduces severity of chronic symptoms
### Ensure they get assertive community care + supported employment 
#### Psychotherapy focusing on social skills and cognitive remediation
#### Long acting atypical anti-psychotic which is life-long to prevent relapse
##### Select from one of the following [[Atypical anti-psychotics]] for long term use:
| [[Atypical anti-psychotics]] | Contra-indication | Typical indications                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[Aripiprazole]]             |                   | Young, avoids sedation, prolactinaemia and weight gain | 
| [[Risperidone]]              |                   |                                                        |
| [[Ziprasidone]]              |                   |                                                        |
| [[Quetiapine]]               |                   | Acute intervention, chronic Tx if compliant patient                                                       |
##### Life-long only because it dosen't matter how long you've been on it the risk is all the same
##### Try 2-3 atypicals with at least 1 being a long-acting depot before swapping to [[Clozapine]]
## Complete clinical remission and psychosocial recovery only in 30% overall
### If no response increase intensity of treatment
#### Pharmacological escalation to [[Clozapine]]

---
## Complications
### [[Asociality]] + disorganisation of thought and speech lead to continuous [[Social isolation]] -> [[Unemployment]], [[Homelessness]] and Incarceration 
### 7% rate of [[Suicide]]
### Post-psychotic [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is common
#### Predictive factors include patients with poor social functioning in childhood, long duration of untreated psychosis and depressive symptoms at baseline ^[https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-13-106]
### They develop a [[Metabolic syndrome]] esp. the [[Dyslipidaemia]] **independent of anti-psychotic use** -> and often die from [[Acute coronary syndrome]]
#### [[Obstructive sleep apnoea|OSA]] is pervasive

---
## Aetiology
### Monozygotic concordance is 40% -> heavy but not complete genetic influence
### Activated by multiple environmental hits
![[Pasted image 20210325155815.png]]
- [[Cannabis]], early life [[Sexual assualt]]
- Obstetric insult:
	- Maternal starvation
	- Hypoxia, prematurity and LBW causing perinatal hippocampal injury
	- Second trimester exposure to influenza virus -> oftentimes births at late winter and early spring have higher incidences of schizophrenia
## Pathophysiology
### Cannabis use ONLY in those < 14 y/o in individual with COMT val/val allele -> increases trigger risk
### Positive features of psychosis are due to excessive dopamine acting on D2Rs in mesolimbocortical dopaminergic pathways
#### Specifically:
##### Excess striatal dopamine load
##### Depleted cortical dopamine load
### Negative features of psychosis are due to excessive serotonin acting on 5-HT2ARs in serotinergic pathways
