Aliases: Washbasin ataxia
---
# Presentation of falling over when eyes are closed E.g when washing face -> O/E When the patient is able to stand with feet togther and eyes open, but is unable to stand for 60s+ without  falling when the eyes are closed
## Part of:
### [[Sensory ataxia]] or [[Vestibular ataxia]]
### If they have a cerebellar cause of the ataxia -> they either:
#### will not be able to stand up in the first place even with their eyes open
#### have mild degeneration -> sway alittle with eyes open -> sway more with eyes closed -> **but never seem to sway enough to fall**

Mechanism: Destructive lesion in either the vestibular or proprioceptive afferents results in reduced fidelity of postural stability in the standing posture. Which can be revealed when visual cues are removed. Mild cerebellar syndromes can also show up with a +ve Romberg's sign.
