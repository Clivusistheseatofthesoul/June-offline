# Malnutrition or deficiency of thiamine causing CNS damage
## Clinical features: triad
### [[Altered mental status]] -> most often a quiet global confusion, with [[disorientation]], [[Avolition]] and derangement of memory -> with some showing frank [[Korsakoff psychosis]]
#### They appeared [[Excessive daytime sleepiness|Drowsy]] sometimes falling asleep in mid-sentence, while others showed marked [[La belle indifference|indifference]]
#### Unable to concentrate on simplest task
### [[Diplopia]] -> typically from opthalmoplegia which is most commonly [[Abducens palsy]] but can be any E.g horizontal or vertical conj gaze palsy, INO etc
#### [[Nystagmus]]
### Isolated [[Gait ataxia]] without UL involvement
## DDx: Secondary to [[Vitamin b1 deficiency|Thiamine deficiency]]
### [[Alcohol use disorder]] + poor food intakes -> so rich alcoholic's are not affected -> [[Homelessness]]
### [[Starvation]], [[Anorexia nervosa]], [[Hyperemesis gravida]]

# Tx
## Prophylactic IV thiamine without confirmation from labs 
### If they are an at risk population with eye signs -> just give IV 300-500 thiamine with Mg2+ 
---
## Complications
### Progression towards full [[Korsakoff psychosis]]

---
## Aetiology
### Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is required to compensate for increased metabolic rate and increased glucose intake utilisation
## Pathophysiology
### Affects 3 main thiamine dependent metabolic pathways (*ATP*)
#### Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase -> Kreb's cycle -> no ATP + no glutamate -> therefore also no GABA
#### Transketolase -> Ribose-5 phosphate shunt -> no anabolic pathways for neurotransmitters, NAD+ and DNA
#### Pyruvate dehydrogenase -> no Acetyl CoA -> no Acetylcholine or myelin
