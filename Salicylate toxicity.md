Aliases: Aspirin intoxication

# 
## Clinical features:
### Early phase of [[Tinnitus]],[[Nausea and vomiting]] and [[Suspected Vertigo]]
#### [[Respiratory alkalosis]] -> transforms to -> [[Metabolic acidosis]] as salycilic acid builds up
### Late phase of [[Hyperpyrexia]], reduced LOC till [[Coma]]
#### [[HAGMA]]
## DDx:
### Overdose in [[Aspirin]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Labs
### Pathological diagnosis with serum salicylate level
---
# Tx
## Activated charcol decontamination if within hrs of intake
## IV fluids with following
### Glucose -> prevent CNS deprivation of fuel source
### Bicarbonate -> alkalinises urine and increases excretion
## If all else fails -> [[Haemodialysis]]

## Aetiology
### If genetic, state most common association first in following structure
1.  Nomenclature for exonic variants: where X is Wild-type amino acid and Y is allele amino acid
	`Inherited/somatic + (inheritance pattern) + silent/misense/nonsense allele leading to -> Xxx-codon number-Yyy on _GENE_ locus (99p/q99) -> leading to LOF/GOF mutation causing + (describe effect and precipitants) `
2.  Nomenclature for intronic variants
	- 
3.  Nomenclature for repeat expansions
