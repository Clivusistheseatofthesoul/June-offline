## Clinical features:
### [[Extreme excercise]] with post-excercise Proximal muscle [[Myalgia]] and [[Cocacola urine]]
## DDx:
### Primary causes:
#### [[Extreme excercise]]
#### Prolonged collapse after [[Fall in the elderly|fall]] esp. in the elderly
### Secondary to metabolic [[Myopathy]] -> [[McArdle's disease]]
### Drug induced -> [[Statin]] esp. if coprescribed with clarithromycin, [[MDMA]]
### Secondary to induced muscle tetany
#### [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], [[Akinetic-rigid crisis|Akinetic crisis]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Screen with serum CK -> CK 10x ULM 
### Urinalysis looking for Myoglobinuria

# Tx
## Fix Electrolytes in order of immediate lethality risk -> consider dialysis if refractory to medical Mx
    -   Hyperkalemia
    -   Hypocalcaemia
    -   Metabolic Acidosis
    -   urea and sodium -> leads to disability but not lethality
## Fluids
-   Fluids
-   More fluids -> the fluids will not fix the problem (unlike in pre-renal AKI but they are needed for support especially if they have Hypovolaemia
