# A group of signs which occur  due to destructive lesion towards the LMNs
## Includes: 
### [[Weakness]], [[Generalised muscle atrophy]], [[Generalised Hypo-reflexia]], [[Fasciculations]]



## DDx: 
### Infectious cause -> [[Poliomyelitis]]
### Toxic -> [[Lead toxicity]]
### If combination of UMN with LMN findings -> [[MND]]
### Other degenerative diseases effectingonly the LMNs -> [[Spinal muscular atrophy]]

Mechanism: Destructive lesion to the LMNs (aka anterior horn cells) of the #ventral_horn or any component leading to the #skeletal_muscle
- #ventral_horn -> #spinal_root -> #nerve_plexus -> #peripheral_nerve -> #NMJ -> #skeletal_muscle 
Seen in: #Neuro #peripheral_nerve #Toxicity #infection #neurodegeneration

When either weakness (or hypotonia if onset was recent) is detected on limb neuro exam, it is important to differentiate between an UMN cause and LMN cause of weakness.
- LMN signs have a variety of causes
