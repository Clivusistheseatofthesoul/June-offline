# Approach to amenorrhea

Seen in: O/G
Sign: Primary or secondary ammenorhea present...now what to do?
Sub-signs: Primary%20amenorrhea%20d2a501987d124384a4e649c143bc25ef.md, Secondary%20Amenorrhea%2061d49c353e194a5c86038fb09fc2a5cc.md

Amenorrhea can occur in the premenarchal adolescent (primary amenorrhea) or in the adult of reproductive age with previously normal menses (secondary amenorrhea).

Despite the truckload of differentials all causing amenorrhea, primary and secondary amenorrhea can be worked up with a systematic classification of causes based on level of pathology, they just have slightly different pathologies under each level.

Consider the different disorders based on level of control:

- Hypothalamic and pituitary (WHO type 1)

    Characterised by **Low FSH**/LH → Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal anovulation

    - Hypothalamus
        - Low body weight, stress or exercise-related amenorrhoea by → [[Benign constitutional delay in puberty and growth]]
        - Craniopharyngioma or other tumours affecting the hypothalamus
        - [[Infiltrative disorders of the hypothalamus|Infiltrative disorder]] ^[https://www.notion.so/loleggsde/Infiltrative-disorders-of-the-hypothalamus-d1e05e60acef4a2ead8fad5469667abd]  of the [Hypothalamus](../../Localisation%2060873530bb4e483da3b01a3b06d2aa2b/Localisation%205b4a5d3a1dce4b4eac946983da607acb/Hypothalamus%204ab60a4e954646a6b89ce5aa814df7ab.md)

            eg, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis

        - Amenorrhoea combined with anosmia → genetic cause of isolated GnRH deficiency → Kallman's syndrome
        - Idiopathic
    - Pituitary
        - Sheehan syndrome - (panhypopituitarism, typically infarction of pituitary after an episode of substantial hypovolaemia e.g. postpartum haemorrhage)
        - Prolactinoma
        - Other sellar lesion -> stalk compression (more hyperprolactinaemia) + gonadotroph atrophy
        - Brain radiotherpy
        - Post-pituitary surgery
    - Both -> by endocrine suppression:
        - Hyperprolactinaemia
            - From prolactinoma
            - Or stalk compression
        - Hypothyroidism
- Hyperandrogenic anovulation (WHO type 2)

    Characterised by **normal FSH**/LH, normal oestrogen, but high androgens in the female → Normogonadotrophic 'normogonadal' anovulation

    - Overwelmingly **PCOS**
        - Primary PCOS → due to metabolic syndrome
        - Secondary PCOS → PCOS secondary to endocrinopathy:
            - Adrenal disorder → secreting lots of DHEA → increased androgen antagonism → PCOS
            - [Cushing's syndrome/ hypercortisolism](Cushing's%20syndrome%20hypercortisolism%20994a7df4b62b4cc3890fbc98f11346c0.md) → ACTH-oma and GC-oma
            - Thyroid dysfunction (leading to WHO type1)
- Ovary (WHO type 3)

    Characterised by **high FSH**/LH yet low oestrogen → hypergonadotrophic hypogonadal anovulation (sometimes called **primary ovarian insufficiency/failure)**

    - Genetic
        - Turners
        - Fragile X *FMR1* premutation
        - Other mutations -> Gonadal dysgenesis mutations + steroidogenic hormone deficiency + hormone resistance syndromes
    - Autoimmune ovarian failure
    - Ovarian toxicity
        - Chemo and radio
        - Viruses -> can cause oophritis
            - Mumps
            - CMV
        - Other
            - Smoking
    - Steroidal hormone deficiency and resistence
        - Steroidogenic hormone deficiency → causing virilisation and congenital adrenal hyperplasia
        - androgen insensitivity
        - 5-alpha-reductase deficiency
- Post-ovulatory patholgy in Uterus and/or vagina

    Characterised by normal FSH/LH, normal oestrogen and androgens yet amenorrhea → ovulatory amenorrhea

    - Congenital abnormalities
        - Cervical stenosis (rare)
        - Imperforate hymen
        - Pseudohermaphroditism
        - Transverse vaginal septum
        - Vaginal or uterine aplasia (eg, Müllerian agenesis)
    - Acquired abnormalities
        - Asherman syndrome
        - Endometrial tuberculosis
        - Obstructive fibroids and polyps

- The symptoms and signs teased from the clinical assessment provides vital information to narrow the ddx list:
