## Clinical features:
### Shorter Hx of multiple CN palsies with long-tract signs and without raised ICP
## DDx:
###
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Interventional
#### Biopsy is not advised as MRI is diagnostic!

---
# Tx
## Non-resectable
## Medical therapy only

---
## Complications
### Diffuse nature results in fulminant silent progression without signs of mass lesion

---
## Aetiology
### If genetic, state most common association first in following structure
1.  Nomenclature for exonic variants: where X is Wild-type amino acid and Y is allele amino acid
	`Inherited/somatic + (inheritance pattern) + silent/misense/nonsense allele leading to -> Xxx-codon number-Yyy on _GENE_ locus (99p/q99) -> leading to LOF/GOF mutation causing + (describe effect and precipitants) `
2.  Nomenclature for intronic variants
	- 
3.  Nomenclature for repeat expansions
