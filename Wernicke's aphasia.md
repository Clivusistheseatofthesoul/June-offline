# "Doc, nothing my husband says makes any sense"

## Description:
### [[Fluent aphasias]] secondary to disturbance in entire language comprehension -> resulting in confused speech which is often misinterpreted as delirium
### [[Paraphasias|paraphasic errors]] and [[Neologism]] are rampant -> sentences become poorly constructed with impaired syntax
### However speech is produced fluently and without effort -> when confronted, oftentimes they canno't understand their own speech
### Normal rhythm and inflexion are preserved and there are no articulatory defects
### The speech can be excessive: [[Logorrhea|pressured speech]]
### They canno't repeat phrases
### There may be associated [[Anomia]], [[Circumlocution]] and (if severe enough) [[Word salad]]
#### Typically object comprehension is spared
#### Only severe cases have circumlocutory speech or word salad
### Reading and writing are often also impaired similarly 
#### Single words may be read aloud correctly, but reading out of sentences becomes jumbled and contaminated by paraphasic errors
## DDx:
### [[Dominant MCA infarct]]
## Mimics:
### Delirium

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion to auditory association cortex of the posterior 1/3 of #superior_temporal_gyrus and middle temporal gyri of the #dominant hemisphere or #Wernickes_area -> grossly defined region in the lateral and posterior temporal cortex 
- Vascular supply by: #ICA → #MCA -M1 → MCA-M2/3 → ??

**Seen in:** #Neuro #Ischaemia
