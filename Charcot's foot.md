# Classic rocker-bottom foot deformity produced by chronic degenerative/regenerative change to the bony composition of the foot joins due to chronic peripheral nerve damage and microtrauma -> endstage of diabetic (or 'Charcot') neuro-oestroarthropathy
## DDx:
### [[Charcot neuro-oestoarthroapthy]] is most commonly caused as a the sequelae of microvascular complications to [[T2DM]] -> aka [[Diabetic foot]]
### Other causes of peripheral [[Distal symmetric polyneuropathy]]-> [[Alcoholic neuropathy]]
### Originally seen as part of [[Tabes dorsalis]]

Mechanism: Deafferentation of the foot
- Microvascular damage -> ascending symmetric polyneuropathy due to affecting and 'dieback' of mainly small fibres -> repetitive joint microtrauma + dysregulated sympathetic vasomotor neuropathy -> associated dysregulation in joint bloodflow -> hyperaemia -> increased osteoclasic resorption

We want to intervene before the foot looks like this:
