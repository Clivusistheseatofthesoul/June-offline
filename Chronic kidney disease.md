# Complication Tx
## Indicat

# When do we consider renal replacement?
## Dialysis when there is refractory *HAVE PEE*
### Hyperkalaemia
### Metabolic acidosis
### Volume overload
### Elevated urea
### Pericarditis
### Encephalopathy
### (O)edema

---
## Complications
### Impairment of 1-25OH vitamin D formation -> reduced Ca2+ and PO4+ absorption from gut -> [[Hypocalcaemia]] with secondary [[Hyperparathyroidism]] when the PTH glands attempt to compensate
