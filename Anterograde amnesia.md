Mechanism: Destructive lesion anywhere along the PM or AT networks 
- Mammillary bodies + mediodorsal thalamic nuclei -> fornix -> hippocampus 
	- Associated parahippocampal + retrosplenial cortex and precuneus -> medial entorhinal
- Amygdala + vmPFC -> hippocampus 
	- Associated perirhinal cortex -> lateral entorhinal cortex

Seen in: CNS
