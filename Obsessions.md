# Intrusive thoughts which persist despite one's will → I.e they are egodystonic
## Description:
### The thoughts are often particularly repugnant to that individual
| Type of person | Obsession               |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prudish        | Sexual Thoughts         |
| Religious      | Blasphemy               |
| Timid          | Torture, Murder, Mayhem |
### Sometimes the obsession can take the form of contrast thinking -> where the stimulus provokes egodystonic thinking which is direct contrast with the individuals beliefs
>   This can be compulsive blasphemy, as, for example, in the case of the devout patient who was compelled to make blasphemous rhymes, so that when the priest said ‘God Almighty’ she was compelled to think ‘Sod Allshitey’
