# Moderatly reduced generation of thought and behavious -> lack of spontaneous movement and speech → prolonged latency and reduced persistence in tasks
# Lack of volition may appear to dissappear on the phone → may speak animatedly over the telephone (Miller Fisher's telephone effect)
## Includes:
### [[Miller fisher's telephone effect]]
## Description:
### Disorder of reduced self-generated thoughts and movements
### Individuals with abulia will act at the prompting of others
### Volition may still be intact

## Mimics:
### Avolition and other motivational disorders

## DDx:
### From an ischaemic stroke or secondary damage to medial frontal networks
### Sub-cortical damage to same circuits due to bilateral basal ganglia lesions
#### [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]]
### Severe [[Major depressive disorder]]
### Secondary to [[Catatonia]]

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesions anywhere to the "centro-medial core" of brain frontal-subcortical circuitry → disruption of generating goal driven behavior mediated by the meso-limbo-cortical dopamine pathways: #ventral_striatum or #dorsal_striatum -> #anterior_thalamic_nucleus -> bilateral frontal periventricular white matter -> #anterior_cingulate_cortex
- vascularised by #ICA -> #ACA and #MCA -M1 -> specifically the anatomical variant #artery_of_Percheron 
- typically abulia (minor) manifests from a #dominant ACA infarct while akinetic mutism manifests from a bilateral ACA infarct
**Seen in:** #Neuro #Ischaemia #mass_lesion

It is debated whether abulia and apathy are interchangable terms or if apathy is the milder version of abulia.
- [[Akinetic mutism]] is the severe form of abulia
- Abulia may be very hard to differentiate from catatonia and may just occur secondarily from a catatonic state
