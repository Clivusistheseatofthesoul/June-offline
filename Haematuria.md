Haematuria is caused by the prescence of intact RBCs in the urine.

- The intensity of the red is correlated with location and severity of bleeding into the urinary tract:
    1. The lower down the urinary tract → the more bright red the urine is
        - bleeding from the kidneys → results in more [Brown urine](Brown%20urine.md)
    2. The faster the bleeding → the more bright red the urine is
