# Summary
-   HepD can only occur in the context of HepB
    -  either infected with HepB together (acute infection); or in an  individual with a current Hep B infection (Superinfection)
   
    -   HepD is a RNA virus with a single reading frame taht is coated in the HepB infected virion envelope!
		-   Does not intergrate into the genome of the host cell -> easier to eliminate and treat 

	
# Aetiology
## Spread
### Requires [[Hep B]]
## Pathogenicity

---
# Clinical manifestations
## Only causes [[Chronic hepatitis]] -> does not cause acute hepatitis
## [[Chronic hepatitis]] if not cleared -> [[Chronic liver disease]] [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]]
### rate of Chronic hepatitis progression is modified by [[Alcohol use disorder]], co-infection with [[HIV]], [[Hep B]]
## Also [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]
## potentially [[Coronary artery disease|CAD]] and [[Carotid artery stenosis]] 


---
# Dx
## IgM to diagnose current or recent infection
## IgG stays for life -> demonstrate previous infection 

---
# Tx 
## Control can only be maintained with Entecavir and Tenofovir
### Other antivirals which work for HepC do not work for HepD
