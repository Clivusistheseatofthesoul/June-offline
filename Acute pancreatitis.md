## Clinical features:
### Acute onset [[Epigastric pain]] -> with most radiating [[Boring pain]] towards the back 
#### [[Nausea and vomiting]]
### Fulminant necrotising pancreatitis -> [[Cullen's sign]] and [[Grey-Turner's sign]]
### Hx of gallstone disease Sx
### Hx of alcohol use
## DDx:
### 50% -> [[Choledocholithiasis]]
### 25% -> [[Alcohol use disorder]]
### 25% -> other
#### Iatrogenic from Post-ERCP
#### [[Hypercalcaemia]]
#### [[Pancreatic cancer]]
#### Medication induced
##### [[Anti-retrovirals]], [[Valporate]], [[Azathioprine|Azithioprine]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Labs
#### LFTs -> billiary obstruction
#### TAGs 
#### Serum Ca2+ -> which can be normal even if hypercalcaemia is the cause -> hence repeat in several weaks
### Diagnosed with 2/3:
#### 1. 	Consistent clinical findings
#### 2. 	Lipase elevation 3x ULN
##### The severity of lipase elevation does not predict severity of disease and does not track improvement
#### 3. 	Consistent imaging
##### If suspected gallstone pathology -> US abdomen then MRI
##### ERCP within 24hrs if ascending cholangitis or demonstrated gallstone disease casusing pancreatitis on US/MRI 
##### If unsure of dx -> CT
##### OR worse in 72hrs despite supportive therapy -> CT
### Determine severity (and start acute treatment)
#### Bloods should include CRP
##### CRP > 150 is a bad prognostic indicator for pancreatic necrosis
#### Severity is assessed by organ failure and prescence of complications
##### You can have either interstitial or necrotising pancreatitis based on radiographic appearance
##### Actual severity is based on combination of features
|          | Organ failure                 | Complications         |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Mild     | No organ failure              | No complications      |
| Moderate | Organ failure <48hrs duration | Complications present |
| Severe   | Organ failure > 48hrs         | Complications present                       |
### Assess for complications
### Determine aetiology
#### Serum calcium with calcium repeat in several weeks 
#### If still uncertain -> MRCP in 8 weeks

# Tx
## Acute treatment
### Almost all will have hypovolaemia
#### In abscence of hyponatraemia -> administer isotonic cystalloids
##### 5-10mL /kg/hr Until following goals met:
- HR < 120bpm
- MAP 65-85
- Urine output > 0.5-1.0 mL/kg/hr
### Initiate pain control
#### IV opiates -> morphine or hydromorphone
### Avoid TPN Nutritional support
#### Initiate limited low-fat diet within 48hrs of admission provided pain and associated Sx of pancreatitis are improving
#### If there is severe disease or persistent pain -> consider NJ tube
#### Only if that fails -> TPN
## treat the cause
### Cholecystectomy if choledocholethiasis
#### If necrotising pancreatitis -> do in same admission
#### If non-necrotising -> do in 8 weeks
### If infection suspected -> treat infection
### E.g Ascending cholangitis, infective pancreatic necrosis etc
---
## Complications
### Fluid cutoff from the exit duct -> [[Peripancreatic fluid collection]] 
#### Abx if there is evidence the fluid collection is infected
##### Repeat CT abdo -> gas on imaging
##### Clinical deterioration after a period of stability
#### Surgical drainage indicated if suspected infection or severe symptoms
##### rapidly enlarging collection
##### Evidence of infection 
### Abdominal compartment syndrome
#### Fluid collection + ileus => raised intra-abdominal pressure
#### Renal vein compression -> Renal hypoperfusion
#### Elevation of diaphragm -> Hypoventilation 
### Enzymatic degradation of vessels -> Retroperitoneal haemorrhage or [[GI bleeding]]
### Splanchnic vein thrombosis
### Pancreatic duct disruption
### Fulminant systemic inflammation ([[SIRS]]) -> [[ARDS]] and [[SIRS]] -> [[MODS]]

## Aetiology
### Wide range of insults -> premature intracellular activation of trypsinogen
#### Cellular injury -> loss of Ca2+ flux -> no exocytosis -> zymogen granule buildup -> fusion of granules with lysosomes -> activate zymogens -> trypsin breaks the cell apart
## Pathophysiology
### Damaged acinar cells recruit acute inflammatory response ->
