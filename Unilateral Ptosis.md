Mechanism: Levator aponeurosis dehiscence is caused by detachment of the LPS fromt he tarsal insertion site. Dermatochalasis causes ptosis by the prescence of redundant tissue in the upper eyelid.
Part of: Oculomotor%20palsy%20e566bbb74032431ea2bece5371fd86ba.md, Horner's%20Syndrome%20f57cde2d5b824e01a02fc30b93fe0dae.md
Seen in: CNS, Ischaemia, Opthalmology, Trauma, haemorrhage
Sign: Unilateral drooped eyelid

A complete droop such that the eye cannot open in the abscence of signs of inflammation should prompt immediate examination for the pupillary light reflexes

- **[Oculomotor palsy](Oculomotor%20palsy%20e566bbb74032431ea2bece5371fd86ba.md) likely the cause**

A droopy eyelid on its own without any other signs on general neuro exam is commonly caused by mechanical disturbances to the connective tissue around the upper eyelid:

- levator aponeurosis dehiscence → detachment of the LPS from the tarsal insertion
- Dermatochalasis → prescence of obstructing redundant tissue in the upper eye lid
