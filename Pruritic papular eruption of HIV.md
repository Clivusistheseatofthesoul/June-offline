Sign: Extremely itchy papules which are inevitably scratched, diffusely distributed symmetrically and concentrated on the body and extremities more-so than the face

This is a diagnosis of exclusion → there are numerous other causes of very itchy papules which must be eliminated before something can be attributed to prurigo from HIV specifically.

- distributed symmetrically on body and extremity
- face is less affected
- mucous membranes, palms and webspaces are spared → although mucous membranes may have ulcerative pathology from HIV/EBV
