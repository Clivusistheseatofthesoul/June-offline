# Syndrome of acute severe adrenal cortex hormone deficiency
## Includes:
### Paroxysmal [[Hypotension]] -> [[Syncope]], Paroxysmal [[Sinus tachycardia]] in response to physical or psychological stress -> eventual [[Altered mental status]]    -> [[Coma]]

## DDx: 
### Episode is precipitated by physical ( #infection, #Trauma, [[Myocardial infarction]], [[Thyrotoxicosis]], [[Pregnancy]], [[Hypovolaemia]]) or psychological stressors 

---
### Any causes of adrenal insufficiency -> reduced GC and MC release in response to stress -> produces an adrenal crisis
### [[Primary adrenal insufficiency]] -> (Autoimmune) [[Addison's disease]], if young -> [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]]
### [[Secondary adrenal insufficiency]]-> things impairing ACTH release -> [[Corticosteroids]], sellar mass lesions, [[POMC deficiency]] 

## Complications:
### Electrolyte disturbances -> [[Euvolaemic hyponatraemia]], [[Hyperkalaemia]]

Mechanism: Paraventricular nucleus of #hypothalamus -> corticotrophs of #anterior_pituitary -> #adrenal_cortex zona glomerulosa (+/- zona fasiculata) Mainly the mineralcorticoid (with minor role from glucocorticoid deficiency) → resulting in low BP → shock
Seen in: #endocrinology

This is a ==**medical emergency**== caused by both deprivation mineral and glucocorticoid**.**

- Symptoms and signs precipitate as acute episodes onseting over hours:
    - Abdominopelvic pain + N/V
    - Global neurological symptoms → From Hypoglycaemia + Hyponatraemia
    - Fainting episodes → Hypotension + hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis labs → Automatically **Addison's disease**


There are multiple different causes:

- Primary
    - Addison's disease
    - Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome
    - If peads → congenital adrenal hypoplasia
- Secondary
    - Pituitary macroadenoma → obliteration of rest of pituitary gland → low ACTH → cannot secrete glucocorticoids in response to stressor
    - **Addison's secondary to precipitant patient on chronic steroids**
        - missed a shot
        - concommitant infection or stressor
