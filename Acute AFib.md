Aliases: Afib with RVR
---
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (HR > 120BPM)
## Clinical features:
### RVR -> HR > 120 bpm at rest
#### Said to irregularly irregular -> but hard to tell when just feeling pulse
### Other features of acute symptomatic Afib:
#### New onset [[Acute heart failure|ADHF]]
#### [[Palpitations]], [[Syncope]]

## DDx:
### Caused by 'chronic' background [[AFib]]
#### Oftentimes brought on by transient trigger in elderly:
##### Recent cardiothoracic surgery
##### [[Acute heart failure|ADHF]]
##### Electrolyte derrangement
##### Infection -> mainly [[Pneumonia]]
### Cardiogenic causes of acute AFib
#### Long standing heart failure
#### [[Coronary artery disease]]
#### [[Hypertension]]
#### Valvular heart disease -> esp. Mitral valve pathology -> [[Mitral stenosis]] and [[Mitral regurgitation]]
#### Existing arrhythmias -> [[WPW syndrome]]

### Non-cardiogenic
#### Provoked by transient trigger in young: **Lone AF**
##### Infection -> [[Pneumonia]]
##### Metabolic -> [[Thyrotoxicosis]], [[Alcohol intoxication]]
##### Electrolytes -> K+ and Mg2+
## Mimics:
### Afib with aberrancy
## Workup:
### ECG diagnosis
### Imaging
#### TTE is typically done to workup aetiology of AFib -> but only really needed to be inpatient if:
#### 
##### current [[Acute heart failure|ADHF]] or suspected MI
##### New onset AFib -> Onset < 48hrs ago (i.e you saw it start happening and know that there isnt time to form a clot)
##### you are considering cardioversion in someone with chronic AFib -> in that case will need a TOE

# Tx of Symptomatic AFib
## Do i cardiovert?
### If haemodynamically unstable -> anaestatise and emergently [[cardiovert]] to get them back to sinus rhythm
#### If you have time to give them heparin -> they are not unstable
#### Unstability is -> if I do not shock in seconds they will die
#### unstability is rare -> consider following causes
##### Pre-existing CCF
##### Concurrent additional causes of shock E.g acute MI, hypovolaemia
##### [[WPW syndrome]]
## Always obtain an ECG after cardioversion
### Not only to official document rhythmn control, but to look for ischaemic changes not visable on telemetry or on chaotic trace from AFib before


## If symptomatic but stable -> always give rate control (so you turn them into [[AFib|Persistent AFib]])
### Aim for HR < 110

#### Do they have an ECG that looks like this?
##### This is [[WPW syndrome]] -> **do not give all standard drugs are CI** -> use procainamide or ibutilide
#### If ADHF:
##### IV digoxin 
Prefer over amiodarone unless in renal failure (CI in renal failure)
##### IV amiodarone 150mg over 10min (despite this being technically a rhythm control agent)
Amiodarone is CI if there is a demonstrated LA thrombus
#### Otherwise: start rate control from selection below
##### IV Diltiazem 5-10mg -> may repeat after 15min
##### PO Diltiazem 30mg q6hrs
##### IV metoprolol 2.5-5mg -> may repeat q15min to max 15mg
##### Eventually transition to PO
### If Asymptomatic -> rate vs rhythmn control depends, consult cardiology
#### Typically rhythmn control if lone AF 

## Treat reversible aetiology
### Infection -> [[Pneumonia]]
### Metabolic -> [[Thyrotoxicosis]], [[Alcohol intoxication]]
### Electrolytes -> K+ and Mg2+

## Will i eventually Rhythm control/cardiovert this person?
### Afibing for < 48hrs = New onset AFib
#### Goal is to always eventually shoc or pharmacologicallay cardiovert/rhythm control them
### AFibing for > 48hrs or unknown duration = Assume [[AFib|Chronic AFib]]
#### Assess likelihood of benefit with eventual cardioversion 
##### If either: Old, structurally diseased heart, coronary artery disease, lots of comorbidities -> do not cardiovert -> just leave on rate control
##### **If: Young**, and healthy heart structurally, no CAD, not alot of comorbidities -> **eventually cardiovert/rhythm control**
1. Anticoagulate for 3 weeks
2. Before TOE-cardioversion (either pharmacological or electrical)
	- Electrical
	- Chemical
		- Amiodarone if existing heart disease
		- Flecainide if no existing heart disease
	- Surgical ablation
3. Further anticoagulate for 1 month
The process is so laborious because of the risk of chronic AFib -> blood stasis in LAA -> cardioembolic [[Ischaemic stroke]]

## TBC in [[AFib#Tx|Chronic AFib]]

# Tx of asymptomatic AFib
## Put in IV, cardiac telemetry

## Admit?
### Hypotension
### ADHF
### Suspected MI
### Systemic embolisation
### Plan for urgent cardioversion that cannot be done in ED
### Inadequate rate control on ED oral meds alone
## Monitering
### If sinus again on telemetry -> obtain an ECG anyway (allows you to conclusively document conversion on chart, finds evidence for ischaemia and confirms the new rhythm is *actually* sinus)
