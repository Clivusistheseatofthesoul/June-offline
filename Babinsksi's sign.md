# Upgoing/extensor plantar response to scratching of the lateral plantar surface of the ipsilateral foot

Mechanism: Destructive UMN lesion to the lower motor neurons powering the toe flexor and extensors causing loss UMN inhibition of peripheral extensor reflex:
- Betz neurons travelling down the corticospinal tract: #countralateral #M1 -> #posterior_limb_of_internal_capsule -> #medial_aspect_of_crus_cerebri #cerebral_peduncle -> #ventral_pons -> #medullary_pyramid -> #motor_decussation -> #ipsilateral #corticospinal_tract in #lateral_funiculus of spinal cord 
Seen in: #Neuro

The Babinski reflex is a primitive reflex (normal before 2yrs of life) which is extinguished by development of a peripheral cutaneous flexor reflex.
- The **first movement** of the big toe is recorded as the one which counts towards the babinski's test. Flexion of the toe first before the scratch has reached the ball of the foot will count as downgoing/flexion plantar response (negative test for babinksi's)
- **The knee must be extended**, even if the patient is sitting; an upgoing toe may be abolished by flexion of the knee
