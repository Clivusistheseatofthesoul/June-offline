The primary lesion is a pink-to-red flat macule or papule.

-   Annular, [targetoid](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/target-and-targetoid-lesions/), [urticaria](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/urticaria-an-overview/)\-like or polymorphous morphology may occur.
-   Lesions mostly blanch with pressure but may be non-blanchable ([purpuric](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/purpura/)) on the lower legs.
-   Discrete lesions may merge together to form large erythematous patches or plaques.
-   Axilla, groin, hands and feet are usually spared.
