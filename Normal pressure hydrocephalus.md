# Ventricular dilatation despite normal CSF opening pressure on LP 
## Clinical features: Classic triad
### Frontal or a [[Broad-based gait|Broad based]] -> [[Magnetic gait]]
#### The strides are short and steps are slow -> it looks like their feet are stuck on the ground
#### However rarely ~10% have a [[Parkinsonian gait]]
### Typically a frontal executive dysfunction -> either frontal cortical or subcortical syndrome -> [[Dementia]] specifically sub-cortical dementia phenotype 
#### Rarely the only disturbance -> usually occurs in conjunction with incontinence or gait problem
#### Subcortical dementia phenotype 
##### [[Bradyphrenia]] -> forgetting, difficulty recall, takes longer to find the words
Notable lack of aphasia, agnosia, neglect -> cortical dementia symptoms
### [[Urinary daytime frequency]] with [[Urinary urgency]] -> sometimes progresses [[Urinary incontinence]]
#### CSF infiltrating periventricular WM tracts
## DDx: Most cases are idiopathic -> some cases will point towards PMHx with event leading to arachnoid granulation obstruction
### [[Meningitis]], [[Traumatic brain injury]], [[Subarachnoid haemorrhage]]
###
## Mimics:
### Pseudodementia 
## Workup:
### MRI-brain
#### Looking for ventriculomegaly without evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus 
##### Evan's index > 0.3 
##### There needs to be clear hydrocephalus out of proportion to the cortical atrophy
### Perform a large volume LP
#### Remove 30-50mL -> repeat walk test 4hrs later to check for improvement
#### If no improvement -> check a few days later -> improvement is often delayed
#### If they do not respond at all -> extended lumbar drain
### Admit and lumbar drain if still unsure

# Tx
## If they respond to LP CSFsection -> they will respond to VP shunt
### Predictors to shunting:
#### Younger age, less cerebral microvascular disease, less medical comorbidities
### Gait improves the most -> cognitive and urinary issues don't improve that much...

## Complications
###

---
## Aetiology
### Hypothesised to be due to blockade of CSF resorption at the arachnoid granulations 
## Pathophysiology
