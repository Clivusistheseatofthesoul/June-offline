### 80% of paitents will have _ENG_, _ACVRL1_, and _MADH4_ mutations
1. Endoglin (_ENG_) gene, which encodes a receptor for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) and transforming growth factor beta-3
2.  _ACVRL1_ gene, which encodes the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK1)
3.   _MADH4_ gene, which encodes SMAD4, a protein active in the TGF beta signalling pathway
