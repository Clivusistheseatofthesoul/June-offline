# Fixed 'false' belief that is idiosyncratic and not in alignment with the person's previous social or cultural beliefs
## Description:
### Although classically it does have to be a 'false' belief, occassionally it can be coincidentally true
>  A very common delusion among married persons is that their spouses are unfaithful to them. In the nature of things, some of these spouses will indeed have been unfaithful; the delusion will therefore be true, but only by coincidence
### Split into primary (aka. apophany) or secondary delusions (aka. delusion-like ideas)
#### Primary delusions occurs directly either paroxysmally or from linking together normal perceptions
##### Sudden delusional ideas occur abruptly out of the blue 
##### [[Delusional perception]] where multiple different percepts are linked together and attributed a false 'conspiratorial meaning'
#### Secondary delusions occur as explanations for primary delusions
##### This results in progressive 'systematisation' where delusions are explained by one another -> which eventually lead to one basic delusions explaining all the tohers
### Sometime people may have fixed false beliefs which may not feel severe enough to be a delusion -> this is an 'over-valued idea'
#### Overvalued ideas tend to develop over a chronic time period 
##### There is an abrupt onset of delusions
#### Overvalued ideas tend to still take the influence of other models and people's opinion -> the patient may be open to your challenge of the idea
##### Delusions tend to be completely indifferent to the opinions of others
#### Overvalued ideas tend to be better organised and often completely plausible
##### Delusions can be (but aren't always) completely inplausible
