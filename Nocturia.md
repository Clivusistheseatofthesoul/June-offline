# Needing to get up in the middle of the night to go pee

## Part of:
### [[Diabetes insipidus]] [[Irritative storage symptoms]]

## DDx:
## #renal -> causes of [[Chronic kidney disease]]
## #endocrinology -> Causes of reduced ADH release  -> causes of [[Diabetes insipidus]] 
## #lungs -> [[Obstructive sleep apnoea]] -> hypercapnia induces low ADH state
## low volume voids + other LUTS -> #Urology -> [[Bladder storage diseases]]


Mechanism: (Potential loss of) circadian increase in global ADH level during sleeping is inadequate to compensate for pathological process causing increased volume of urine
