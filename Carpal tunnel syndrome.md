Aliases: CTS

# Weakness/wasting of thenar eminence, loss of sensation of lateral half of hand, positive tinel's sign, positive phalen's sign
## Part of:
### [[Acromegaly]], [[Hypothyroidism]]
## Includes:
### Palmar finger numbness that is most bothersome/painful at night -> [[Nocturnal paresthesia]] and [[burning dysesthesia]] like pain of the hands -> **it will wake them up**
#### [[Unilateral First, index, middle finger sensory loss]]
#### But the pain itself can sometimes radiate up the arm and to the shoulder in up to 50% of people! 
### [[Tinel's sign]], [[Phalen's sign]]
### Weakness is a late sign -> Unilateral thumb abduction weakness -> [[Pincer grip weakness]] + isolated [[Thenar eminence wasting]]
## Mimics:
### Degenerative Cervical spondylosis! Always check UMN signs!
## DDx:
### Entrapment due to -> [[Manual labor jobs]] and other repetitive compressive traumas to the wrist; but also [[Obesity]]
### Secondary to exisiting pathology:
#### Ganglion cyst
### [[Mononeuritis multiplex]] from -> [[Diabetic neuropathy]], [[Hypothyroidism]]
### [[Pregnancy]]
### [[Rheumatoid arthiritis]]

Mechanism: #ipsilateral compressive destructive lesion to the superficial branch of the #median_nerve going through the #carpal_tunnel
Seen in: #peripheral_nerve 

---

## Workup:
### CTS is a electrophysiological diagnosis to locate exact point of compression 
#### Serum TSH, and HbA1C for secondary aetiology screen 
---
# Tx
## Mild CTS is treated with wirst splints Â± local corticosteroid injections
## Moderate-severe CTS is treated with surgical decompression Â± local corticosteroid injections 
### Criteria:
#### Anyone refractory to wrist splints 
#### Anyone with weakness or thenar atrophy
---
## Complications
###

---
## Aetiology
### Increased pressure at carpal tunnel -> microvascular impairment of 
## Pathophysiology
### Subtle ischaemia causes spurious generation of action potentials, segmental demyelination, and ultimately axon loss: paresthesias -> dysaesthesia -> sensory loss -> weakness
