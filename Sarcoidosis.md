# Granulomatous inflammatory disease 
## Clinical features:
### Presents as [[Lofgren's syndrome]] with progressive [[Dry cough]]
### Classically pulmonary sarcoid (90%)
#### [[Interstitial lung disease]]
### Other systems involved
#### Most commonly also affecting liver [[Chronic liver disease]]
#### [[Neurosarcoidosis]]
#### Lymphadenopathy
#### Dermatological -> [[Erythema nodosum]], [[Lupus pernio]]
#### MSK -> polyarthralgia
#### Cardiac -> [[Restrictive cardiomyopathy]], [[Conduction abnormalities]]
#### Kidney -> [[Nephrolithiasis]], Nephrocalcinosis, [[Interstitial nephritis]]
## DDx:
### Idiopathic development of systemic granulomas 
## Mimics:
### Tuberculosis 
### Other causes of ILD
### Lymphoma
## Workup:
### UA and ECG
#### Proteinuria for kidney involvement
#### Heart blocks and restrictive cardiomyopathy on ECG
### Labs
#### Serum ACE 
##### Raised in sarcoidosis typically (but can be not +ve)
#### LFTs
### CXR -> HRCT 
#### Mediastinal lymphadenoapthy sometimes can see pulmonary nodules when done on HRCT
### PET scan -> showing active inflammation to show all the granulomas 
### Bx the granuloma
#### Will have non-caseating granulomas with epitheloid cells

# Tx
## Mild Sx -> watch and wait
## Moderate Sx -> immunosuppression
### Chronic course of PO prednisone 
### MTX of azithioprine 
## Lung transplant in severe pulmonary fibrosis

# Prognosis
## Typically resolves in 6 months in 60% of patients
## Typically die because of affecting heart or particular regions of the CNS
