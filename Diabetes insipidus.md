# Combination of Large volume polyuria, nocturia and +/- polydipsia
## Includes:
### Large volume [[Polyuria]] with [[Polydipsia]]
### [[Nocturia]] Â± [[Nocturnal enuresis]]
### Supportive labs -> [[Hypernatraemia]] with urine Osm < 300
# Approach:
### 1. Determine severity of diabetes insipidus
#### Hypotonic urine losses -> Urine Osm < Serum Osm -> Complete diabetes insipidus
#### Isotonic or hypertonic urine losses -> Urine Osm > Serum Osm -> some water transport remaining -> partial diabetes insipidus
### 2. Administer desmopressin challenge
#### If partial diabetes insipidus -> consider going straight to MRI brain and/or therapeautic trial of Desmopressin -> because challenge does not differentiate between the two
## DDx: Causes of ADH deficiency
### Iatrogenic override -> [[diuretics]] intoxication 
### Absolute ADH deficiency -> Central diabetes insipidus
#### Destructive lesion of the hypothalamus -> [[Craniopharyngioma]], [[Infiltrative disorders of the hypothalamus]]
#### Supportive labs -> >50% increase in urine Osm
### Relative ADh deficiency -> Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
#### Medication induced kidney damage -> [[Lithium]], [[Amphotericin B]], [[Cisplatin]]
#### Pathology causing tubulointerstitial disease
##### [[Sickle cell anaemia]], [[Myeloma kidney]], Renal infiltrative disease
##### Electrolyte derrangements -> Chronic [[Hypercalcaemia]] or [[Hypokalaemia]]
##### [[Gestational diabetes insipidus]]
#### Supportive labs -> <50% increase in urine Osm
## Mimics: Diabetes mellitus!

Mechanism: Deficiency of ADH or receptivity to ADH results in inability to retend fluid via tha ADH pathway
- #Paraventricular_nucleus_of_hypothalamus + #supraoptic_nucleus_of_hypothalamus within the #hypothalamus -> secretion of ADH into posterior pituitary circulation -> acts on collecting_duct intercalated cells -> ADH-R binding -> AQP-2 vesicle migration towards apical surface

Combination of large volume dilute pee that continues through the night and is often accompanied by excessive drinking of typically cold or ice water is the cardinal feature of diabetes inspidus.

- You become **dry and salty with extreme thirst**
    - They will drink anything

![This is extreme thirst](https://i.redd.it/ao99ml91ohkz.jpg)
- do not mistake for diabetes mellitus
