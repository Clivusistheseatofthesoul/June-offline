### Indictors for screening into drug history
### 'Stress,' [[Insomnia]], recent mood disturbance
### [[Headache]] that is worse in the morning, [[Reduced appetite]]
### Screen for prescence with *CAGE* or *CRAFFT* (if adolescent
### Determine amount
#### Alcohol
##### Convert into standard drinks (/10g EtOH)
###### Schooner, stubbie or can of full-strength beer (5%) is 1.5 standard drinks
#### Benzodiazepines
##### Convert into diazepam equivalents per day (or number of 5mg diazepam tabs) 
#### Cannabis
##### Number of cones per day, grams per day, dollar amount
#### Heroin
##### Dollar amount per day, weights or grams per day (0.1g = $50)
#### Methamphetamine
##### Number of points (0.1 gram) per day, dollar amount
#### Cocaine
##### number of grams or dollar amount
#### MDMA
##### Number of tablets per occasion, or how many grams of powder

### Determine severity of use
1. Cognition: Issues with control
    -   Having too much and not being able to stop
    -   Inability to cut down despite wanting to do so
    -   Spending too much time trying to get the thing or doing the thing
    -   **Craving** of constant rumination about the thing
2. Risk behaviors
    -   hazardous/dangerous consequences
        -   during driving
        -   during sex (including having sex to obtain the thing)
    -   medical complications
        -   getting other physical injuries/diseases secondary to the thing and continuing to use
    -   Legal complications
3. Pharmacological impairment
	- Tolerance and withdrawal mark the transition to dependent use where the drive shifts from pursuing the euphoric effects to avoiding the chronic withdrawal
    -   **Tolerance** -> need more of the thing to get the same effect
    -   **Withdrawal** -> withdrawal symptoms classic of each thing or substance
        -   If you have this alone can be used as a rough guide for alcohol -> can provisionally call alcohol use disorder but other things are not as clear cut
4. Social impairment
    -   Inability to fulfill obligations at work, home or school
    -   Impaired social relationships due to the substance itself
    -   **Replacement** of other activities with the thing/substance

## Complications
### Relapse
#### If relapse occurs -> it will go all the way -> they canno't go back to just 'chipping' on the thing

---
## Aetiology
### Reinforcing behaviors are started to feel good
### It becomes addiction when we require the reinforcing behavior just to feel normal
#### Factors determining progression are:
##### Those without stable 'niches' -> [[Adolescent]], [[Impoverished]]
##### Those who have parental substance use disorder
##### Concomittant mood disorder or [[PTSD]] -> [[Major depressive disorder|MDD]], [[Bipolar I]] and [[Bipolar II]]
##### Chronic use and accessibility 
## Pathophysiology
### Tolerance due to allostasis within the mesolimbic pathways
#### Downregulation of D2 receptors in NA core -> normal activities become blunted and ineffective at inducing motivation drive
### Some form of predilection to need the substance of behavior to feel normal in terms of mood, pleasure etc
#### Everytime they take the thing they become more tolerant and there is increased behavioral drive to need the thing -> so their quality of life baseline *worsens* after each time
#### Eventually they need to take the thing just to compensate enough to feel normal before becoming sober where they feel miserable
#### The psychological craving and 'need' for that substance to recover to normality is addiction
