## Clinical features:
### [[Mask-like facies]] with lost prosody, quiet and monotonous -> bradyphrenia 
#### Early on they can still laugh -> just the default facial muscle tone and engagement of expressive behaviors is altered 
#### Also commonly have [[Sialorrhea]], reduced blinking rate 
### They may have cognitive deficits but typically these are limited to
#### Minor executive dysfunction
#### Minor word finding hesitation
#### Executive pattern minor memory impairment (mainly retrieval dominant)
### It's not the tremor thats bothersome its the -> [[Akinesia]] that is initially very fustrating 
### Have a triad of features -> [[Parkinsonism]] of which any on of them can be the dominant symptom
#### Oftentimes this is lateralised as a manifestation of [[Dopaminergic neglect]]
### [[Motor decrement]] -> also leading to [[Micrographia]] where the writing gets smaller as they continue to finish a sentence
### May have a [[Parkinsonian gait]] which may or may not be festinating, include freezing around doorways and turning, and in severe cases -> inability to initiate gait at all 
### **Abscence of other FND and age 50+ **
#### Young age of onset should immediately prompt search for non-primary causes and diligent search for atypical parkinsonian syndromes
## DDx:
### Primary (i.e idiopathic) -> [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]]
### Secondary to another pathology -> [[Vascular parkinsonism]], Drug induced parkinsonism, [[Wilson's disease]]
## Mimics:
### Atypical parkinsonian disorders
## Workup:
### Clinical diagnosis when there are no clear features of atypical parkinsonian disorders -> check with response to [[levo-DOPA]]

# Start medical Tx only when of significnat impact
## Start [[levo-DOPA]] when the patient percieves it to be of significant impact
### If only mild/moderate severity in a pateint age â‰¤ 65 -> can consider starting with [[Dopamine agonist]] monotherapy instead 
### If tremor dominant form -> consider adjunct with [[Amantadine]]
## If moderate-severe disease -> always use levo-DOPA 
# Supportive therapy
## Vitamin D supplementation if low
### Minimises falls risk and improves sleep
## glycopyrronium bromide for drooling
# Advanced therapies only work for those that responded to levo-DOPA in the first place
## DBS only for motor symptoms that were previously responsive to levoDOPA
### Indications
#### Relief of motor akienesia and tremor
##### Does not provide any relief for non-motor signs E.g Gait freezing, postural instability
### Absolute contraindications
#### Psychiatric disease
### Relative contraindications
#### Advancing age
# Monitering
## Ensure adherence and education about what happens if the drug is suddenyl stopped/not absorbed -> [[Akinetic-rigid crisis|Akinetic crisis]]
## Regular medication review is essential in patients with PD
### check for interactions and minimise polypharmacy

---
## Complications
### Impaired swallowing and cough reflex -> [[Aspiration]] -> [[Pneumonia]]
