# Change in the angle of the nail bed towards 180, most easily seen in the 4th digit -> don't bother with shamroth's window -> too hard to ellicit in elderly -> their fingers are either chicken drumsticks or not clubbed at all

Mechanism: Megakaryocytes are broken down into fragments in the lungs and these fragments become platelets -> any disruption to pulmonary circulation -> failure of fragmentation -> megakaryocyte survival into distal systemic circulation -> wedged into end arteries in extremities -> release PDGF -> recruits and promotes proliferation of underlying muscle + fibroblasts
Seen in: #Neoplasm #lungs #liver #cardio #GI

Fingers that are pathologically clubbed will be obvious -> don't bother with Shamroth's window mainly because it will be very hard to explain the maneuver to an elderly person -> they either look like chicken drumsticks or they are not clubbed
