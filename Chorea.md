# Chorea is a nonrhythmic, jerky, rapid, nonsuppressible involuntary movement, mostly of the distal muscles and face. Although purposeless but oftentimes these movements may be incorporated into semipurposeful acts that mask the involuntary movements
## Description:
### Sudden, jerky, irregular movements with muscle contractions that are not repetitive or rhythmic but **appear to flow** from one muscle to the next
#### If asked to keep tongue out -> [[Trombone tongue]]
#### If asked to stretch hands out and keep fingers still -> motor impersistence results in piano playing movements
#### If they holding the examiners fingers in her fist-> [[MIlkmaid's grip]]

### [[Athetosis]], Dyskinesia and ballismus are all forms of chorea 
## Part of:
### [[Sydenham's chorea]]
## 
## DDx:
### With FHx -> [[Huntington's disease]], [[Wilson's disease]]
### Post-infectious cause -> [[Sydenham's chorea]]
### During pregnancy -> [[Chorea gravidarum]]
### Drug induced chorea -> [[levo-DOPA]], [[Anti-psychotics]]

Mechanism: Chorea and athetosis result from impaired inhibition of thalamocortical neurons by the basal ganglia potentially from excess dopaminergic activity or lesion(s) to the basal ganglia themselves
