## Clinical features
### [[Hypertension]] resistant to typical Anti-HTNs
## DDx:
### Primary hyperaldosteronism -> [[Conn's syndrome]], [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|CAH]], aldosterone secreting tumor (adenoma or carinoma)
#### Renin is normal or low
### Secondary hyperaldosteronism -> [[Renovascular diseases]], [[CCF]], [[Chronic liver disease]], [[Nephrotic syndrome]], Renin secreting tumor
#### Renin is high 
### Pseudohyperaldosteronism -> [[Cushing's syndrome]] and iatrogenic [[Corticosteroids|Glucocorticoids]]
#### Aldosterone is actually normal or low with normal or low renin 
#### Instead the GC is high enough it binds sufficiently to the MR

# Approach
## Serum Renin:aldosterone 
### Low/normal renin -> primary cause 
### High renin -> Secondary cause
