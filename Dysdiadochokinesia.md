Mechanism: Lesions towards the #cerebellum/spinocerebellum and #cerebellum/cerebrocerebellum  → destruction of centres calculating coordination of complex movement in the distal extremities → delays in motor initiation + delays in termination + abnormalities in force and acceleration calculations → quickly exacerbating the changes seen in dysmetria → dysdiadochokinesia
Seen in: #Neuro
