# Reduced peripheral visual field at all angles -> like looking through cardboard tubes
## DDx:
### Bilateral PCA infarcts from [[Air embolim]], [[Fat embolism]]
### Rare -> Tentorium cerebelli [[Meningiomas]]

## DDx:
### Tubular vision! Suspect if they defect size remains the same however far you go out -> if child -> check for abuse  and NAI 
### [[Retinitis pigmentosa]], Chronic [[Glaucoma]]
### Chronic [[Papiloedema]]
### Transient tunneling esp. with postural change -> [[Orthostatic hypotension]]

**Mechanism:** 
- Destructive lesion of peripheral retina
- #bilateral destructive lesion to #anterior_striate_cortex but sparing of the occipital pole 
	- Vascularised by: #bilateral #PCA -> #calcarine_artery 

**Seen in:** #Neuro #Ischaemia #Neoplasm

## Cases
 

A 72-year-old man was referred with suspected hysterical visual deficit. His visual acuities had been documented at 6/6 but he claimed he could not see, and when he attempted to walk continually fell over furniture and was even unable to eat a meal because of difficulty with his vision. His visual fields had not been tested. On examination he had total loss of the peripheral visual fields with only 1° or 2° of intact macular vision. The total loss of peripheral vision meant that he could only see in the direction of gaze. Changing his direction of gaze was extremely difficult because the lack of peripheral vision meant that he had no target to guide him. Everything he saw was seen by accident. His problem would be best appreciated by trying to walk around a room with 3-foot long cardboard tubes held to both eyes. CT scanning revealed bilateral posterior cerebral artery territory infarction with sparing of the macular cortex.
