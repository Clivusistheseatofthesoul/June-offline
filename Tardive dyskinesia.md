# Repetitive, involuntary, painless movements [[Tardive syndromes|induced after taking an antipsychotic]]
## Description:
###  Dyskinesias induced include -> choreiform, myoclonic and athetoid movements
#### Early signs co-occur with discontinuing or lowering of dose of perpetrating anti-psychotic 
### Areas classically involved include:
#### Face and lips -> Oro-facial dyskinesia
##### Eyebrows
##### Eyelids -> [[Blepharospasm]]
##### Perioral ->  -> Puckering, pouting and [[Lip smacking]]
 Can be subtle -> [[Sucking in of lower lip]]
#### Jaw and tongue -> bucco-linguo-masticatory dyskinesia
##### Jaw -> biting, clenching, chewing, opening and particularly **lateral movement of jaw**
##### Tongue -> protrusion and back, twists and curls
#### Limb and extremity -> 
##### Choreiform and athetotic movement of fingers -> Piano-playing fingers, fingers splitting
##### Trunk ->lordosis, rocking and shoulder shrugging
## DDx:
### [[Anti-psychotics]]
### Non-anti-psychotic neuroleptics:
#### [[Metoclopramide]]
####  Oral contraceptives, anticonvulsants, [[TCAs]]
## Mimics:
### Tardive syndromes with similar timeline
#### Tardive dystonias are more slowed sustained contraction

**Mechanism:** Prolonged dopamine blockade -> reduced activity along nigro-striatal pathway -> no gain in cortico-BG-thalamus loops -> manifestation in motor loops -> inability to properly select balanced motor programmes + hypersensitisation in motor loops
- Atypical anti-psychotics have 5-10x lower risk compared to typical anti-psychotics
- Genetic predisposition with: Inherited autosomal recessive homozygous mutated alleles of the cytochrome P450-2D6 gene

# Tx
## Taper and switch anti-psychotic
## 50% are expected to have full recovery with discontinuation of the anti-psychotic after a few years
### Children almost always recover, elderly only have a 30% rate of full recovery
