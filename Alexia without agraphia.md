# "I can see, I can write but I just can't read" when you spell out the word for them they can still recognise the word
## Description:
### Isolated inabilty to read anything
### Oftentimes describing everything to be written in this foreign, 'oriental scripture'
### O/E
#### Isolated [[Alexia]] and a **right** [[Homonymous hemianopia w macular sparing]]
##### The patient can write spontaneously and to dictation, though subsequently they bizarrely cannot read what they have just written

## DDx:
### [[Ischaemic stroke]]
### [[Posterior cortical atrophy]]

Mechanism: Destructive lesion specifically to entire left #V1 AND the crossing #inferior_longitudinal_fasiculus in the #Splenium of the posterior #Corpus_callosum -> preventing visual information from the spared right visual cortices entering the visual language recognition regions in the dominant (typically left) angular gyrus visual word form area (VWFA) -> 'reading'
- Spelling of words gets input into the angular gyrus through the auditory pathway and bypassing visual bottom up input
- Infarction of the medial occipital region + inferior splenium (splenial-occipital variant):
	- Vascularised by the #non-dominant #PCA	
- Infarction of the lateral geniculate body + splenium: Spleniogeniculate variation
	- dominant occipitotemporal paraventricular white matter surrounding the psoterior horn
- Infarction of superior and rostral lesion in the dominant hemisphere parietooccipital or parietal white matter (subangular or paraventricular alexia)

Alexia without agraphia (aka pure alexia aka pure word blindness). Oftentimes a strange presenting complaint. On examination the only deficit will just be a **right homonymous hemianopia.**

- Most commonly caused by a left PCA infarction destroying the **right occipital â†’ VWFA tract in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus** inside the splenium
