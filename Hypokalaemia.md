# [K+] < 3.5 mM
## Clinical features:
### Symptoms appear by < 3.0 mM
#### Muscle weakness with legs > arms -> [[Flaccid paraplegia|Flaccid paraparesis]] -> progresses towards [[Flaccid quadriplegia|Flaccid quadriparesis]]
##### [[Ileus]]
#### Cardiac arrythmias -> [[AFib]] and sometimes even [[VT]] and [[Torsades de pointes]]
### Aetiology is typically obvious on history
#### Recent diarrhoea, diuretics, medication change
## DDx:
### Poor K+ intake (profoundly)
#### [[Starvation]]
### GI losses
#### [[Vomiting]], [[NGT]] drainage
#### [[Acute diarrhoea]] and [[Chronic diarrhoea]]
#### [[Laxative]]
#### Iatrogenic secondary to bladder resection
### Renal losses
#### Diuretics -> [[Loop diuretic]] esp. if combined with [[Thiazide diuretic]]
#### [[Hyperaldosteronism]]
#### [[Renal tubular acidosis]] (Types 1 and 2)
#### Salt wasting nephropathy
#### Drug induced -> [[Amphotericin B]]
#### Extreme polyuria -> [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]], [[Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia state|HHS]], [[Polydipsia]]
#### [[Hypomagnesaemia]]
### Internal redistribution
#### [[Insulin]]
#### Catecholamines either internally in the setting of critical illness or exogenously -> [[Dopamine]], [[Vasopressors]]
#### Causes of alkalaemia -> [[Metabolic alkalosis]] and [[Respiratory alkalosis]]
#### marked cell proliferation -> treating [[Vitamin b12 deficiency]]
## Mimics:

## Workup:
### ECG

#### ST depression
#### T wave flattening then inversion
#### Prominent U waves -> oftentimes seen as fake T waves

### Aetiology
#### Labs
##### Mg2+ 
#### UA and ABG to sort between remaining aetiologies

| Metabolic acidosis  | Diarrhoea and most cases of [[Laxative]] abuse    | RTA types 1 and 2 along with [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] |
| Metabolic alkalosis | Vomiting and some rare caes of [[Laxative]] abuse | [[Hyperaldosteronism]] and salt wasting nephropathy    |

# Tx
## Urgency of repletion is dependent on
### rate of hypokalaemia development
### prescence of high risk complications E.g VT, QT prolongation and MI
## Address underlying aetiology
## Repleting K+ typically to be 4.0 -> don't need to suprareplete unless lots of comorbidities
### PO KCl elixir or pill
#### The drink tastes awful and it is a giant horse pill
### IV KCl only if NPO (Put on cardiac monitering)
#### Peripheral line -> This is painful! Make sure its slow -> must be < 10mEq/hr 
#### Central line -> must be < 20mEq/hr
### Amount depends on current value
| Current [K+] | Increase by 0.1mM      | Amount required to get to 4.0mM |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 3.0-4.0      | 10mEq                  | 100mEq                                |
| 2.5-3.0      | 15mEq                  | 175mEq                                |
| 2.0-2.5      | 20mEq                  | 275mEq                                |
| <2.0         | Patient is likely dead | Patient is likely dead                                |
#### If close to 4.0 -> can get away with one time dose
#### Regime to get someone back from really hypokalaemic values -> will replete 240 mEq
##### IV 40mEq KCl q4hr 3 times to replete 120mEq
##### PO 40mEq KCl qAC 3 times to replete another 120 mEq
Given with food to avoid GI upset
##### BMP in the middle to convince pharmacy you're not giving someone a lethal injection
### If K+ has not budged by the next day
#### IV 1g Mg should fix it 
### Consider add on K+ sparing diuretic if caused by loop diuretic or hyperaldosteronism instead of long term K+ repletion

## Complications
### Arrythmias like -> [[AFib]] but also acutely dangerous ones like [[VT]] and [[Torsades de pointes]]
#### Risk is increased with
##### [[Hypomagnesaemia]]
##### [[Myocardial infarction|MI]]
##### [[Digitalis toxicity|Digoxin toxicity]] and other QT prolonging drugs
