# The abscence of the sense of smell as measured by inability to detect ipsilateral familiar non-noxious scents like coffee powder and mint in one nose only

## DDx:
### Mass lesion -> olfactory groove [[Meningiomas]]
### olfactory bulb infarct -> [[Ischaemic stroke]]


---
Mechanism: Destructive lesion to the afferent olfactory pathways projecting into the primary olfactory cortices (O1): #CN_I -> #Olfactory_bulb -> #olfactory_tract -> bilateral #anterior_olfactory_nucleus through the #anterior_commissure -> #O1 
- Vascularised by: #ICA -> #ACA -A2 -> #olfactory_artery
- partial anastamosis to ventral surface of olfactory bulb through: ICA -> #opthalmic_artery -> #accessory_olfactory_artery
Seen in: #Neuro, #Neoplasm, #Ischaemia
