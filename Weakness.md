# Partial or incomplete paralysis -> -plegia if complete paralysis
### Part of:
### [[UMN signs]], [[LMN signs]] 
### [[Hemiparesis]] -> [[Faciobrachial hemiparesis]], [[Crural hemiparesis]], [[Uncal herniation syndrome]]
### [[Paraparesis]] -> [[Spastic paraparesis]]
### [[Brachial diplegia]]
### [[LMN facial weakness]] [[UMN facial weakness]]

Mechanism: Any disruption from the motor centres to efferent motor pathways to contraction in the skeletal muscle

Paresis is used when it is not complete loss of power (MRC 2-4), while -plegia is used to denote near complete â†’ complete paralysis (MRC score 0-1).

- There are different severities of wekaness which are graded by the MRC scale

MRC grade | Clinical sign
------------| -------------
0 | No movement at all
1 | flicker of muscle twitching but no movement
2 | movement against no resistance and no gravity 
3 | movement against gravity only
4 | movement against some resistance
5 | full power of movement


- There are different patterns of paresis -> systemic or localised 

The approach to weakness is typically done using the 'Iron-Cross of weakness:'

### PEARLS
1. Cortical vs subcortical infarcts
	- Cortical lesions bias severity of certain groups over others -> subcortical lesions produce **dense hemiplegia**
	- Cortical lesions are often associated with sensory deficits -> while subcortical infarcts are typically pure motor (and sometimes pure sensory)
	- Cortical lesions are morelikely to produce cortical lateralising signs -> aphasias, apraxias, neglect
		- Subcortical infarcts can also produce these by lesioning the basal ganglia
