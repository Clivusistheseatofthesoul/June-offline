# 
## Clinical features:
### [[Acute Dyspnoea]] often with normal cardio but with [[Pulsus paradoxicus]]
#### Sometimes have isolated [[Distant heart sounds]]
### Chest pain is left sided, sharp and often **gets much worse when laying down** ± [[Pleuritic chest pain]]
### Associated with recent infection -> recent fever
### O/E:
#### [[Narrow pulse pressure]]
#### If massive -> you will be able to see it as [[Auenbrugger's sign]]
## DDx:
### Infections -> [[Cox-Sackie B virus]]
### Complication of [[Uraemic syndrome]] -> 'fibrinous pericarditis'
### [[SLE]] induced serositis

# 
## Clinical features:
### [[Acute chest pain]] is left sided, sharp and stabbing
#### Radiating to neck and shoulders of LHS
#### Positional pain -> often **gets much worse when laying down** ± [[Pleuritic chest pain]]
### With [[Acute Dyspnoea]] often with [[Pulsus paradoxicus]]
#### Dyspnoea worsens drastically with supine position -> [[Orthopnea]]
### Associated with recent infection -> recent fever, [[Swinging pyrexia|Swinging fever]]
### O/E:
#### [[Distant heart sounds]], [[Ewart sign]] potentially with developing [[Beck's triad]] if [[Acute cardiac tamponade]]
#### Compressive signs:
| Sign                                        | Significance                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [[Dysphonia]] specifically [[Hoarse voice]] | Compression of recurrent laryngeal nerve |
| [[Dysphagia]]                               | Compression of oesophagus                |
| [[Intractable hiccups]]                     | Compression of phrenic nerve             |
| [[Dyspnoea]]                                | Compression of diaphragm                                         |

## DDx: Secondary to [[Pericarditis]]
### Secondary to [[Myocardial infarction]]
#### Either as early-infarct associated irritation or Dressler syndrome
### Infections
#### [[Cox-Sackie B virus]], [[T. gondii]] infection
### Complication of [[Uraemic syndrome]] -> 'fibrinous pericarditis'
### Autoimmune connective tissue diseases
#### [[SLE]] induced serositis
