# Sterile inflammation of the immermost layer of the heart
## Clinical features:
### Clinical course is variable
### Typically completely asymptomatic until embolisation -> [[Ischaemic stroke]]
### There are classic (but rare) signs O/E:
#### [[Splinter haemorrhages]], [[Janeway's lesions]], [[Osler's nodes]], [[Roth spots]]
### Also look for concomittant infections:
#### [[Septic arthritis]]
## DDx:
### [[Libman-Sacks endocarditis]] produces embolic verrucous vegetations (large thrombi) secondary to [[SLE]] and [[Anti-phospholipid syndrome|APS]]
### Advanced malignancy
### Chronic component of [[Rheumatic heart disease]]
## Mimics:
### Other forms of [[Endocarditis]]
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis
---
# Tx

# Embolisation prophylaxis
## Patients with or without evidence of systemic emboli are routinely anticoagulated provided there is no contraindication

---
## Complications
###

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### Little inflammation at the actual site -> very easily dislodged -> more likely to embolic than infective endocarditis
