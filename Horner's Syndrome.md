# Syndrome of ipsilateral mild ptosis, resting myosis, apparent enopthalmos, +/- anhydriasis, 'bloodshot eye'
## Includes:
### Mild 'upside down' [[Unilateral Ptosis]] -> giving rise to (apparent) [[Unilateral Enopthalmos]]
### Mild resting [[Myosis]] -> only readily obvious when in darker ambient light
### Ipsilateral 'bloodshot' eye
### Light and accomodation reflexes maintained but over smaller range
### Ipsilateral [[Anhydriasis]] 
## Part of:
### [[Wallenberg Syndrome]], [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]], [[Klumpke's palsy]], [[Pancoast syndrome]], Cervical [[Central cord syndrome]]
### When with headache -> [[Cluster headache]], and [[Migraine headache]]
## DDx:
### If present since small -> congenital Horner's syndrome -> Iris will fail to pigment and remain a steely blue colour -> [[heterochromia]]
### Brainstem lesions -> destruction of the sympathetic UMN -> [[Focal pontine glioma]], Various causes of [[Brainstem encephalitis]]
### Cervical cord lesions -> [[Syringomyelia]], [[Glioma]], [[Ependymomas]]
### [[T1 radiculopathy]] -> Cervical rib, [[Klumpke's palsy]],  but more likely... [[Pancoast syndrome]]
### Sympathetic chain -> Superior cervical ganglion + above -> [[Carotid dissection]]

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion to anywhere along the sympathetic pathway from the 1st order 'UMN' From #hypothalamus → #hypothalamospinal_tract (adjacent to spinothalamic tract) descends down lateral brainstem → #lateral_horn #C8 till #T1 found adjacent to central cord → second order preganglionic LMN → paravertebral chains → #superior_cervical_ganglion → postganglionic LMN → #Carotid_bifurcation → internal carotid artery → #cavernous_sinus → through the cilliary_ganglion without synapsing → long cilliary nerve → eye
- Outflow of vasomotor and sweat postganglionic fibres leaves sympathetic fibres **before the superior cervical ganglion**


**Seen in:** #Neuro #Ischaemia #Neoplasm

Horners syndrome is a result of lesional destruction of sympathetic outflow.
- The lesion can be localised based on the distribution of the anhydriasis/anhydrosis:
    - Central lesion → UMN lesion to somewhere along the hypothalamospinal tract → anhydrosis of ipsilateral entire side of body to upper quadrant of body
        - Multiple sclerosis
        - Wallenberg syndrome
        - CNS tumor
        - Brainstem encephalitis 
    - Preganglionic peripheral lesion → Preganglionic lMN lesion somewhere between the spinal root and the superior cervical ganglion → anhydrosis of face only and sometimes no anhydrosis at all
        - Klumpke's palsy → C8-T1 brachial plexus avulsion
        - Apical lung tumor i.e pancoast tumor
        - Thoracic aortic aneurysm
        - Carotid artery dissection
        - Base of neck trauma
    - Postgnaglionic peripheral lesion → Postganglionic LMN lesion somewhere between the superior cervical ganglion and the short cillary nerves to the eye → no anhydriasis
        - Cluster headache
        - Carotid artery dissection 
        - Cavernous sinus syndrome -> usually don't see horner's in isolation -> usually combined with a parasympathetic pupil pathway defect + associated cranial nerve palsies
