# The quintessential autoimmune disease -> affects multiple organ systems at once and has varied presentation depending on organ involved
## Clinical features: 
### Cutaneous Lupus -> Can be an isolated cutaneous lupus syndrome or as a syndrome part of SLE
#### Types of isolated cutaneous lupus include:
##### Acute cutaneous
##### Subacute cutaneous
##### Chronic cutaneous -> [[Discoid lupus]], [[Hypertrophic lupus erythematosus]], [[Mucosal lupus erythematosus]], [[Lupus profundus]] 
#### Photodistributed rashes -> classically [[Butterfly rash]] which is exacerbated by UV light 
#### typically diffuse hair loss -> [[Non-scarring alopecia]], but also [[Alopecia areata]]
### Mucosal -> mouth uclers
### Seropositive arthritis -> Symmetrical, deforming like RA but non-erosive on scans -> when in the hands is called [[Jaccoud's arthritis]]
### [[Serositis]] of the heart and/or lungs
### Blood -> anaemia and thrombocytopaenia
### Renal -> [[Nephritic syndrome]], [[Nephrotic syndrome]] to Fulminant [[AKI]] from [[Lupus nephritis]]
### Neuro -> [[Lupus cerebritis]]
#### Eye syndromes -> [[Orbital apex syndrome]] with [[Painful Opthalmoplegia]]
## DDx:
### [[Drug induced SLE]] -> [[Hydralazine]], [[Isonazid]]
### #Neoplasm -> secondary as a paraneoplastic syndrome from  -> lymphomas or cancers of the lung, breast, or gonads
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Routine labs will reveal inflammatory picture with cytopaenias:
#### [[Haemolytic anaemia]], [[Thrombocytopaenia]]
#### Elevated ESR 
### There is no diagnostic laboratory test -> series of lab tests
#### ANA antibodies are positive for autoimmune disease to rule SLE out
#### Lupus antibody panel, ESR/CRP, C3 and C4 levels 
##### Lupus antibody panel: Anti-dsDNA, Anti-Smith, Anti-Histone
- Anti-dsDNA antibodies are found only when there is kidney involvement -> [[Lupus nephritis]]
- Anti-Smith is found in are found in any form of lupus
- Anti-Histone is found only when lupus is drug induced (*H for Hydralazine*)
##### C3 and C4 is consumed in the immunecomplex deposition in nephritis
### Requires 4+ of the criteria: with at least 1 clinical and 1 laboratory antibody positive finding
#### They can have < 4 if they have Lupus nephritis and +ANA and +Anti-dsDNA

# Tx
## Acute flare:
### IV bolus [[Methylprednisolone]] 1g	
## Chronic Mx of disease without renal or CNS involvement: [[Hydroxychloroquine]] + NSAID (mild pain) or Corticosteroid (moderate severe pain)
### HCQ reduces flares and progression to nephritis and cerebritis
### Oral [[Prednisolone]] 10-25mg daily -> wean off slowly														
## Chronic Mx: Corticosteroids + ([[Cyclophosphamide]] or [[Azathioprine]]) 
### Oral [[Prednisolone]] 1mg/kg daily
### use azithioprine if pregnant
### If isolated [[Lupus nephritis]] -> can use less toxic [[Mycophenolate]]
## Treating med side effects: Steroids
### Premature [[Atherosclerosis]] and [[Hypertension]] that is comparable to T2DM ->  treat with Statin and ACEi
## Monitering
### Disease activity can be measured by serial ANti-dsDNA serology
### UA at every consult -> haematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts -> suggestive of [[Lupus nephritis]] -> needs confirmatory renal Bx
---
## Complications
### If [[Pregnant]] -> [[Pre-eclampsia]]
### If on long standing [[Corticosteroids|Glucocorticoids]] -> Premature [[Myocardial infarction]]
### Predisposition for [[Lupus cluster]]
### Development of [[Anti-phospholipid syndrome]]
