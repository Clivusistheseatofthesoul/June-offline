## Behavioral intervention
### Everyone gets Brief intervention through *FLAGs*
#### Mostly applicable for those with either risky alcohol use and not sufficient for those with established dependence
#### Provide them the feedback sheet and identify together if there are things that they've experienced
#### Listen to what they want and what matters to them

 Identify where they are in the stages of change 
#### Advice -> use the wheel of change

Alot of people get so bogged up about the relapse that they'll self-medicate -> drink to drown the shame
> If you give someone a plan that's your plan, if they come up with a plan its their plan
- GIve them the information they need to choose their goals 
- market how life can get so much better if they go away from drinking
#### Goals -> set smart goals with them
##### Talk about the safe drinking limits (<2 small drinks)
#### Strategies
##### Identify high risk situations (E.g everyone drinks at work after the day's over) -> Daybreak app
##### Alternating alcohol with non-alcoholic drinks ->swap it for something else
##### Eating during drinking sessions
##### C.I in those with severe chronic liver disease, cautious use in those with severe CKD
#### [[Naltrexone]] is better for intermittent binge alcoholic abuse → reinforcing group who get the hedonic 'pleasure still' → by reduction in positive reinforcement 
##### C.I in those using opiods, having SurgHx in next few weeks, cautious prescription in those with severe chronic liver disease
#### [[Disulfram]] is better for those actively wanted to abstain → motivated group → by inducing positive punishment upon intake of alcohol
##### Not on PBS# The more you think about not doing something the more you do it ("Don't think about camels")
##### Schedule plan's to do something else -> especially when its pay day
##### Make the alcohol as hard as possible as it is to get to, make the alternatives as easy as possible to get to 
#### Forgive yourself
##### Don’t be hard on yourself if you have one drink too many -> Forgive yourself and start again tomorrow. 
### Motivational interviewing
#### Those most angry tend to benefit the most
### CBT and DBT
## Other non-pharmacological interventions
### Improvement of adherence to medical followup
### Setting of SMART goals
### Mindfulness based therapies
### Group  counselling
#### Some use alcoholic anonymous
#### Men's groups E.g Men's shed
#### Women's groups
## Pharmacological interventions
### 3 main options:
#### [[Acamprosate]] is better for chronic alcohol use → neuroadapted group who drink to feel normal → by reduction in long term psychological craving
#### [[Naltrexone]] is better for intermittent binge alcoholic abuse → reinforcing group who get the hedonic 'pleasure still' → by reduction in positive reinforcement 
#### [[Disulfram]] is better for those actively wanted to abstain → motivated group → by inducing positive punishment upon intake of alcohol
## Monitering
### Serial LFTs looking for return to normal of GGT if it was elevated before

# Secondary prevention of relapse
## 60% of everyone will achieve long-term recovery
## Abstinence is the best way to go in well established dependence
### If early/mild dependence, and mostly binging not neuroadapted -> harm minimisation effective and can often return to controlled drinking
### Encourage abstinence for at least 1 year if not for whever possible in those who are neuroadapted (5% can but most find it very difficult)
## Recover's have *CHIME*
### Connected socially
### Hope for future
### Have their own Identity
### Life meaning other than drinking
### Empowered to make changes

---
## Complications
### If prevented from drinking -> will start to undergo [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome]]
### Brain -> [[Vitamin b1 deficiency|Thiamine deficiency]] -> [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]] and [[Korsakoff psychosis]], [[Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration]]
### Respiratory -> relaxation of pharyngeal muscles -> [[Obstructive sleep apnoea|OSA]]
### Liver -> [[Alcoholic liver disease]] causing [[Chronic liver disease]] and eventually liver cirrhosis
### GI -> Spontaneous [[GI bleeding]], haemorrhagic [[Gastritis]] and [[Acute pancreatitis]]
### Cardio -> [[Alcoholic cardiomyopathy]]
### Blood -> [[Myelosuppression]]
