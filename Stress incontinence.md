Mechanism: Rise in intra-abdominal pressure will reveal either pelvic floor laxity or internal urinary sphincter deficiency 
1.  Urethral hyper mobility is caused by pelvic floor laxity → Vaginal birth, prolonged crowning, and menopause can all cause the pelvic floor musculature to act more like a trampoline than a concrete floor during periods of increased abdominal pressure E.g coughing → prevents complete closure of the urethral lumen → 'stress' induced incontinence
2.  primary internal sphincter deficiency occurs consequently to age and pelvic irradiation → inability for internal sphincter to reflex close fully during increased intra-abdominal pressure
