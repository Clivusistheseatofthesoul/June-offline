# Attentional capture to functional hemispace when stimuli are presented in both hemispaces -> can be for the visual or somatosensory domains 
# E.g if you flash all fingers up on both visual fields they will say '5' instead of '10'; if you touch both hands they will only say the 'left'

### Neglect is 'dense' extinction
## Includes;
### [[Visual extinction]]
### [[Somatosensory extinction]]
### [[Auditory extinction]]
