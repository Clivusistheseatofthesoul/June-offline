# 'Normal' acne -> distribution is typically limited to the face
## Description: sorted by severity
### mild have a few comedones and papulopustules, but no scarring—lesions are often confined to the forehead, nose and chin (the ‘T-section’ of the face)
### moderate have numerous papulopustules and comedones, with some nodules but no scarring—lesions affect extensive areas of the face and sometimes the trunk
### severe have nodules, cysts and scarring—lesions may be confined to the face, but commonly also affect the trunk
## Part of:
### [[Steroid acne]]
## Mimics:
### Rosacea -> also has talengectasia + flushing
### Malassezzia folliculitis -> monomorphic small pustules cover non-facial distribution
###
## DDx:
### Secondary causes
#### [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|CAH]] and [[PCOS]] -> elevated androgens
##### Hirsutism and insulin resistance -> suspect PCOS
##### Mid-childhood onset of acne -> typically pre-pubertal adrenarche or [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]
# Symptomatic Tx
## Mild acne  requires topical treatment only
### Comedomal acne -> [[Topical retinoid]]
### Small papulopustular -> [[Topical retinoid]] with topical antiseptic ([[Benzoyl peroxide]]) or [[Topical antibiotic]] -> may also be combined with [[Topical keratolytic]]
## Moderate acne or mild acne not responding to topical treatment requires additional oral treatment
### Topical treatment + oral antibiotic ± oral anti-androgen 
#### Tetracycline or [[Erythromycin]]
##### Doxycyline or minocycline 50-100mg daily
##### Erythromycin 250-500mg *bd*
##### If no response by 6 months -> stop oral abx
#### Anti-androgen only in females -> [[OCP]], [[Spironalectone]], Cyproterone acetate 
##### Spironalectone 50-100mg daily can be considered when OCP not desired but works best when combined
## For severe acne (causes scarring) or that which does not respond to 3 months of moderate therapy -> [[Oral retinoid]] 
### Requires referral to dermatology 
# Lifestyle and medication change
## Reduce exacerbating medications
### Anabolic steroids, [[Corticosteroids]], [[Lithium]], [[Phenytoin]]
### avoid greasy, oil based moisturisers
## Behavioral changes
### Avoid overwashing
### Stop squeezing or picking lesions
### Avoid hot spa and steam rooms, hot humid environments
## Dietary change
### Reduce dairy intake
### Avoid high glycaemic index diet 
# Consider referral to dermatology
## Acne is resistant to initial therapy
### Anything resistant to 3-6 months of moderate therapy with oral abx ± anti-androgen
## Acne is of suspicious secondary cause
### Specifically hiruitism, acanthosis nigricans -> PCOS
## Teenager desiring treatment with parents against it
## Any patient considering oral isotretinoin

Mechanism: Androgen stimulation of pilosebaceous glands -> secretion of sebum
- blockade of the exit by increased keratin in the opening of the duct -> formation of a whitehead I.e [[Comedome]]
- Overgrowth of bacteria in blocked comedomes esp. Proprionibacterium species
- Rupture of the duct inside the dermis + bacterial colonialisation -> acute inflammation -> red papules -> red nodules -> pustules

Mainly **genetic influence** not to do with facial hygiene
