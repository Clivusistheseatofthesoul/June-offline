# Acute Tx applies to all severities
## 15L supplemental O2 delivery through non-rebreather mask to ensure 94% < SpO2 < 98%
## Nebulised SABA + SAMA for acute bronchodilation
### q30 mins x3
## Steroids for anti-inflammation 
### Minimum of PO prednisone 50mg daily, for 5 days
### Continue normal use of ICS in background
## Assess peak expiratory flow
# Patients are discharged and traiged by response to acute Tx
## Full responders go home when stable on discharge medications for 12hrs
### No longer wheezing
### AND
### Do not require O2 assistance for SpO2 > 90%
### AND
### PEF > 70%
### Other things to do
#### Check inhaler technique
#### Continue with inhaler and PO prednisone wean at home -> all patients requiring ED admission for asthma attack are prescribed a take home ICS!
#### GP follow up in 1 week, specialist review 
## Non-responders go ICU
### Increased O2 demand non-sufficient with non-rebreather
### OR
### Rising pCO2 on ABG
### OR
### PEF < 50%
### OR
### Features of [[Status asthmaticus]] not-responsive to bronchodilation
### They get ventilated, IV methylprednisolone, nebulised SABA + SAMA
## Mild responders go wards
### In the middle
### Still get nebulised SABA + SAMA
### Still get IV steroids and wean onto PO
