## DDx:
### [[CMV]] infection of the retina -> [[CMV retinitis]] -> often occuring in the [[Immunocompromised patient]]

---
Mechanism: CMV selective infects the retinal pigement epithelium -> melanin normally traps light which is the outer barrier of the eye -> loss of melanin gives classic appearance of 'cheese' + visual disturbance
Seen in: #infection  #eyes
