# [[Tremor]] that worsens on adoption of holding a particular posture
## DDx:
### [[Essential tremor]]
#### Severe physiological tremor enhanced by: Caffiene, other sympathomimetics
#### Increased catecholamines -> [[Anxiety]]
#### [[Thyrotoxicosis|Hyperthyroidism]]
#### Withdraw states

**Mechanism:** Simultaneous contraction of agonist + antagonist muscle groups due to combined effect of antagonistic firing + synchronisation of muscle spindle feedback → produces physiological tremor. This tremor can be enhacnced by circulating catecholamines or hyperthyroidism → catecholamine receptor upregulation → increasing the twitch for of any one motor unit twitch force

Seen in: CNS
Sign: T

Most commonly this is present normally in much of the population as a **physiological tremor.** In certain scenarios in certain people, this physiological tremor can become a **enhanced physiological tremor by environmental changes:**

- Anxiety → increased catecholamines
- Sympathomimetic agents → caffiene
- Withdrawral states
- Hyperthyroidism → increased catecholamine receptor expression
