# Tapping the glabella (region between the two eyebrows) causes persistent (4+0 blinking
## DDx: Lesion of the frontal lobe
### But also classically associated with parkinson's disease -> [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]], [[Diffuse Lewy body disease]]

Mechanism: destructive lesion of PMA or basal ganglia → result in failure of inhibitory control of the blink to threat reflex → release of the primitive reflex
Seen in: #Neuro #neurodegeneration
