Sometimes this is also called pseudomyotonia because of its similarity to the signs associated with myotonia
- Pseudomyotonia does not demonstrate EMG changes while myotonia demonstrates clear myotonic discharges on EMG

Delays in relaxation time in patients with hypothyroidism appears to be proportional to the level of thyroid-hormone deficiency
