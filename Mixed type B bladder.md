# A form of [[Neurogenic bladder]]
## Description:
### Typically pure [[Overflow incontinence]] where low volume micturition is reflexive without generation of high intra-vesicular pressure
### Just can't hold it in at all -> they canno't stop their stream in the middle of a pee

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion to LMNs in #Pudendal nucleus (In #S2_segment, #S3_segment, #S4_segment comprising the #conus_medullaris) travelling to the external urinary sphincter while the #Detrusor_nuclei in sacral cord are spared and become disinhibited 
- Inability to contract external urinary sphincter -> micturition occurs randomly due to disinhibition of detrusor
-  Only the detrusor nuclei is deafferented -> Intra-vesicular pressure is normal as there is no simultaneous detrusor-internal sphincter contraction
- Abscence of pudendal signal prevents voluntary stopping of stream midway through micturition
