# Hypoaesthesia means partial sensory loss, Anesthesia means complete sensory loss → lots of different causes 
## Includes:
- Focal Loss of unilateral peripheral limb with clear demarcation +/- weakness -> [[Mononeuropathy]]
- Multifocal (multiple but asymmetrical) loss of unilateral peripheral limb with clear demarcation +/- weakness -> [[Mononeuritis multiplex]]
- Loss of unilateral peripheral limb with messy demarcation +/- weakness -> [[radiculopathy]]
- Loss of bilateral peripheral limb, distal ascending pattern -> [[Glove-and-stocking distribution sensory loss]]
- Loss of bilateral peripheral limb but wierd and don't make no sense -> [[Sensory neuropathy]]
- Loss in particular strip which aligns with a dermatome -> [[Radiculopathy]]
- Trunk loss up to a certain height -> [[Sensory level]]
- Loss of bilateral upper back shoulders and upper arm -> [[Cape distribution sensory loss]]
- Loss of proprioception/vibration on one side and temperature/pinprick other side -> [[Brown-Séquard syndrome]]
- Loss of pinprick/temperature from body on one side and pinkprick/temperature of face on the other -> [[Ipsilateral face + Contralateral body distribution]]
- Loss of complete one side of body -> [['Dense' Hemisensory loss]]
- Loss of incomplete one side of body -> [[Crural-distribution hemisensory loss]], [[Faciobrachial distribution sensory loss]]
- higher order cortical sensory loss -> [[Agraphesthesia]] [[Asterognosia]] somatosensory and/or visual [[Extinction]] [[(Egocentric) visuospatial hemineglect syndrome]] [[Anosognosia]]

Mechanism: Destructive lesion to one of the conscious somatosensory or proprioceptive afferent pathways or the somatosensory maps in the parietal lobe
- Ascending conscious somatosensory pathway: Somatosensation receptors -> peripheral nerves -> DRG -> Dorsal horn -> dorsal columns of spinal cord + spinothalamic tract -> #medial_lemniscus -> #VP-group_nuclei of thalamus -> #superior_thalamic_radiation of internal capsule -> #S1 + #S2 -> parietal lobe  

Seen in: #Neuro, Demyelination, Ischaemia, Neoplasm, trauma

Peripheral neuropathy is the bane of our existence → thank'eth thine good lord for there art an algorithm!
