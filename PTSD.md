# 
## Clinical features:
### Intrusion of thought with cognitive and perceptual features associated with the original stressor

#### [[Flashbacks]], [[Nightmares]], [[Ruminations]] and [[Preoccupation]] on original memories
#### Typically a [[Depressive mood]]
#### There can be [[Depersonalisation]]
#### They avoid anything associated with the original event -> including talking about it... which is what makes Tx hard
#### Continuously [[Hypervigillance|hypervigilant]]

## DDx:
### Severity of the life-threatening stressor and **proximity** to the stressor determines the likelihood of anyone getting the disease
#### Which means that if the stressor is strong enough, even people watching it through the news can get PTSD
### Event related
#### Stressors
##### Actual [[Death's effect on the survivors|death]], threatened death, combat, rape, abused, child neglect
#### Exposure proximity
##### Experienced, witnessed, learned (when happened to a loved one), repeated exposure of aftermath (first responders)
### Person related
#### Genetic predisposition 
## Mimics:
### Acute stress disorder
## Workup:
### PTSD is a clinical diagnosis
#### If duration of Sx is between 3 days - 6 months -> diagnosis is acute stress disorder
#### If duration of Sx is > 6 months -> diagnosis is PTSD
### There is no switch that happens on the day of 6 months -> there's no difference between them
#### The only thing that is different is the response to therapy
