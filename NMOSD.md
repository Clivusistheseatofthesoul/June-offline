# A [[CNS demyelinating disease]]
## Clinical features: Relapsing remitting pattern of lesions due to plaques which can occur sequentially but often occur simultaneously
### [[Optic neuritis]] -> esp. [[Bilateral optic neuritis]]
### Longitudinally extensive [[Transverse myelitis]] -> typically [[Sensory level]], [[Spastic paraparesis]]
### Periventricular demyelination
#### hypothalamic plaques -> [[Narcolepsy]]
#### Area postrema plaques -> [[Intractable vomiting]]

### ___ diagnosis
---
# Tx
## Acute symptomatic relief to reduce inflammation -> IV methylprenisolone + Plasma exchange
### 
## Long term [[Rituximab]] for DMT 
---
## Complications
### If untreated -> permenant [[Blindness]]
#### Predicted by clinical visual signs at presentation 
---
## Aetiology
### Autoimmune generation of Anti-AQP4 antibodies bind to astrocytes 
## Pathophysiology
### Astrocyte dysfunction and inflammation -> demyelination of adjacent neurons
