# [[Optic neuropathy]] caused by ischaemic damage to the optic disk
## Clinical features:
### **Painless** monocular blindness progressive over hours-days
#### NA-PION presents suddenly upon wakening
#### A-PION presents with features of [[GCA]] Â± [[Polymyalgia rheumatica]]
#### Perioperative PION presents with sudden bilateral and profound visual loss upon awakening post-operation -> most commonly cardiac surgery or spinal surgery
#### Typically either [[Unilateral Central scotoma]] or inferior [[Altitudinal visual defect]]
### Ipsilateral [[RAPD]]
### Distinguished from AION by a **normal fundoscopy** acutely -> chronically followed by progressive optic disk atrophy
## DDx:
### Secondary to small vessel vascular disease from [[Hypertension]], [[T1DM]], [[T2DM]] and [[Atherosclerosis]] -> Non-arteritic posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NA-PION)
### [[GCA|Giant cell arteritis]] of the posterior cilliary or orbital arteries -> Arteric posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (A-PION)

## Mimics:
### Optic neuritis 
## Workup:
### PION is a diagnosis of exclusion once everything else is ruled out (except perioperative PION which is straight forward -> patient wakes up post-op blind)

## Aetiology
### The posterior optic nerve is supplied through the pial capillary plexus
> The posterior segment of the optic nerve is separated into the intraorbital, intracanalicular, and intracranial parts. The blood supply to these various sections involve contributions from many branches and arterial sources; therefore, it is not necessary that the pathology of PION be localized to any one artery or location. The intraorbital segment is supplied by both a peripheral centripetal blood supply formed by the pial plexus, and an axial centrifugal blood supply formed by branches of the central retinal artery. The intracanalicular portion is only supplied by the peripheral centripetal system from the branches of the ophthalmic artery, and the intracranial part has only a pial vascular plexus to support it, coming from variable arterial branches.
### Idiopathic cause of reduced optic disk autoregulation -> atherosclerosis or arteritis + further exacerbation of nocturnal hypotension -> hypoperfusion of the optic disk
