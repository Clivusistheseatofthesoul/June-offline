Aliases: Vitamin D toxicity
---
# 
## Clinical features:
###
## DDx:
### Artifical source of vitamin D from body -> **due to granulomas**
#### [[Sarcoidosis]], [[Tuberculosis]]
### Ate too many vitamin D supplements
## Mimics:
### Hypercalcaemia of malignancy -> lab values look similar 
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Serum Ca2+ and PO4+ will be elevated due to vitamin D acting on the gut
#### Serum PTH will be low because it is appropriately suppressed
#### **This is the time where vitamin D is done** -> and 1-25OH vitamin D is high!

## Aetiology
### Physiologial control of serum [Ca2+]
#### PTH controls blood Ca2+
##### PTH Cells with packaged PTH hormone
- Calcium sensitive proteins which prevent exocytosis
- Rise in serum Ca2+ -> calcium senstive protein activated -> reduced PTH secretion
- Decrease in serum Ca2+ -> calcium sensitive protein inhibited -> increased PTH secretion
##### PTH acts on 3 organs:
1. Directly on bone -> increased bone resorption -> elevation in serum Ca2+ and PO4+
2. **directly on kidney** -> if the kidneys are working the **kidney always wins**
	- Retention of Ca2+ 
	- excretion fo PO4+
	- increases 1-25OH vitamin D -> acts on gut to:
		- increase Ca2+ absorption
		- increased PO4+ absorption
3. indirectly on GI
	- Increases 1-25OH vitamin D -> acts on gut to:
		- increase Ca2+ absorption
		- increased PO4+ absorption

#### Artifical vitamin D can be produced pathologically
Certain pathologies produce 1-25OH vitamin D -> which will increase serum Ca2+ and PO4+ levels
- Produced by: granulomas
	- [[Sarcoidosis]]
	- [[Tuberculosis]]
