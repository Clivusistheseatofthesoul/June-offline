Postural hypotension or Orthostatic hypotension is a drop of more than 20 systolic or 10 diastolic between 2-5mins of standing up from lying supine

- Don't get this confused with:
    - Orthostatic intolerance → no noticable immediate BP drop but there is excessive HR increase instead!
    - Vasovagal syncope → Normal BP and HR response on standing → which cannot be maintained → decompensation of BP and HR after while of forced standing (via tilt table)
        - This is typically seen as a physiological response to get your head to the ground quickly → re-perfuse the brain
