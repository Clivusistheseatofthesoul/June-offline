# Phalen's sign

Part of: Carpal%20tunnel%20syndrome%20ca1d0d3e470c41b7aef3071cb96befe6.md
Seen in: PNS
Sign: Positioning both wrists at 90 degree flexion  by pressing them against one another for 1 minute. Prescence of parasthesia during or directly after release of the pressure is suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome

The Phalen's sign is neither sensitive or specific for carpal tunnel syndrome, and hence is performed in conjunction with other tests and investigations to rule in or out carpal tunnel syndrome.
