**Mechanism:** Enlarging infectious or inflammatory mass results in proptosis + cranial nerve palsies which pass into the orbit at the orbital apex +/- pain
**Seen in:** #eyes #infection #Neoplasm

Orbital apex syndrome is caused by an enlarging compressive mass at the apex of the orbit

Looking at the front of the right orbital apex: The contents of the superior orbital fissure (SOF) can be remembered by: **Lemon french tarts, sit naked in annulus."** 
- Note that CN II, sympathetic postganglionics, and the opthalmic artery come through the optic canal which is also in the orbital apex
