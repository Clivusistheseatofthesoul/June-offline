# Type I hypersensitivity reaction within the conducting airways
## Clinical features:
### Not all that [[Wheezing|wheezes]] is asthma -> but wheezing should automatically make you thinking asthma or COPD
#### [[Chronic Dyspnoea]] ± [[Cough]] -> with episodes exacerbated by triggers
##### Dustmites, seasons
##### Occupation -> is it worse when they are off work/ on weekends/holiday?
##### Oftentimes worse at night
### Grade severity by asking for frequency of episodes
#### Daytime symptoms
#### Nightime symptoms -> esp. waking up at night
### Auscultation of the chest can reveal ominous signs of severe disease
#### [[Reduced breath sounds]], [[Hyper-resonant percussion]]

## DDx:
### [[Atopic march]] related
### Secondary to drugs:
#### [[Aspirin]] from leukotriene overload
### Occupational asthma requires specialist referral
#### Gets better on weekends, away from work, on holidays
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### PFTs
#### Either shows normal picture or obstructive picture (FEV1/FVC < 0.7)
##### If normal induce attack with methycholine challenge -> if it causes wheezing and SOB it is asthma
##### If obstructive picture currently -> rescue with SABA -> if reverses to become normal picture again it is asthma

# Tx
## Chronic asthma severity is graded by symptoms and attack frequency
|     | Daytime Sx     | Nightime Sx    | FEV1   | Tx                                                    |
| --- | -------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| I   | <2/7 per week  | <2/7 per month | ~80%   | SABA only                                             |
| II  | >3/7 per week  | >1/7 per week  | ~80%   | SABA + ICS                                            |
| III | Not responding | Not responding | 60-80% | SABA + ICS + Montelucast                              |
| IV  | Not responding | Not responding | 60-80% | SABA + ICS + LABA ± montelucast depending on response |
| V   | > 1 per day    | frequent       | <60%   | SABA + higher dose ICS + LABA                         |
| VI  | Refractory     | Refractory     | ~      | PO corticosteroids + search for cormorbidity                                    |


### Everybody gets SABA prn
### If chronic preventer needed -> [[ICS]] is by far the most effective
#### [[Leukotriene antagonists]] can work as monotherapy preventer if preferred -> but more often use as add-on whenever 
### Moderate or severe asthma -> add LABA with ICS
#### LABA is never used as monotherapy -> increased risk of death!
### If severe refractory -> ICS + LABA + [[Anti-IgE mab]] if serum IgE > 130
### If still poor control despite good adherence we must search for comorbidities -> bronchiectasis, allergic aspergillosis
## Long term Bronchodilation should only be used when there is anti-inflammation 
### LABA cannot be used with SABA alone in asthma -> always use with ICS
## Anti-inflammation reduces chronic airway remodelling 

# Monitering
## If someone is just constantly progressing in severity
### Ensure medication adherence -> is there a lifestyle thign thats preventing them from using their inhaler
### Ensure inhaler use technique is correct
### Add a spacer
## The higher dose of ICS the more side effects
