## Includes: Strict criteria
### [[Central adiposity]], [[Hypertension]], [[Acanthosis nigricans]], Established [[PCOS]], Established [[Coronary artery disease]], Insulin resistance (Incld. [[T2DM]])
### Suppotive labs -> [[Dyslipidaemia]] specifically reduced HDL and [[Hypertriglyceridaemia]]
## Includes: supportive features
### [[Fetal macrosomia]], FHx of Diabetes mellitus, [[NAFLD]] and [[NASH]] 
### Macrovascular disease ->[[Coronary artery disease|Chronic ischaemic heart disease]], [[Ischaemic stroke]], [[Peripheral vascular disease]], [[Acute Ischaemic colitis]]
### [[Cholesterol cholelithiasis]]

## Mimics:
### Careful congenital obesity syndromes -> E.g Laron's syndrome
