# Lesions at the posterior orbit
## Includes:
### Complaint of [[Diplopia]] 
#### Combination of unilateral partial or total opthalmoplegia
##### All 3 nerves are so close in this instance -> its very hard for you to predict the pathology based on order of involvement
[[Oculomotor palsy]], [[Abducens palsy]], [[Trochlear palsy]]
### You will find [[Exopthalmos|Proptosis]], which in combination with visual features tell's you the aetiology of the mass
#### Slow progressive proptosis with little visual loss -> no cranial nerve palsy until very late -> Benign lesion
#### Rapidly evolving cranial nerve palsy and visual loss even when proptosis is mild -> malignant infiltration
#### Proptosis which only appears when lying down, Valsalva, bending forwards -> AV malformation
#### Little/no proptosis but marked multiple cranial nerve palsy -> SOF lesion

### Sometimes [[Horner's Syndrome]] -> myosis, ptosis sometimes with apparent exopthalmos 
## DDx:
### Thyrotoxicosis must always be exluded first in any cause of proptosis (even if unilateral)
### [[Cavernous sinus thrombosis]] either [[Aseptic venous sinus thrombosis]] or [[Septic venous sinus thrombosis]]
### Mass lesion
#### Sellar mass lesions -> large [[Pituitary macroadenoma]] can expand laterally 
#### Intracranial aneurysms -> specifically [[Intracavernous aneurysm - anterior type]] and [[Intercavernous aneurysm - posterior type]]
#### [[Meningiomas]] of the sphenoid wing
####  Chordomas of the basi sphenoid may extend up into the pituitary fossa or laterally into both cavernous sinuses
####  Craniopharyngiomas may behave similarly from above and behind
#### Local extension of carcinoma of the nasopharynx 
### By exclusion -> [[Tolosa Hunt Syndrome]]

**Mechanism:** Close proximity of nerves to vascular structures, sinuses, and the sella turcica result in multiple aetiologies converging at the lateral wall of the #cavernous_sinus to present as cavernous sinus syndrome
- Mass lesions -> esp. pituitary chemophobe adenomas can spread laterally -> impinging on CN III first

- Intercavernous seegment carotid artery aneurysms (of the anterior type) -> impinge CN III and IV first
