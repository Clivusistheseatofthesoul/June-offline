## DDx: 
### Intraluminal obstruction -> secondary to migration of stone from [[Cholelithiasis]]
#### [[Cholesterol cholelithiasis]] and [[Billirubin cholelithiasis]]

Mechanism: 
- constant pain is often due to stretching of the renal capsule due to obstruction, whereas colicky pain can be caused by peristalsis of the genitourinary tract smooth muscle against the obstruction
- dilation, stretching, and spasm caused by the **acute ureteral obstruction** → proximal ureteric peristalsis → colicky nature pain. Visceral nociceptive afferents → sympathetic nerves to ureteric plexus → thoracolumbar spinal cord convergence → radiation in the trunk

Seen in: Renal
