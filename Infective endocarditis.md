# Infection and subsequent inflammation of the immermost layer of the heart
## Clinical features:
### Clinical course is variable
### Typically has history of [[Fever]] and a new [[Heart murmurs|Heart murmur]]
#### Acute progression is fulminant and presents with [[High fever]] and rapid deterioration
#### Subacute progression is insidious and presents with general malaise, [[Myalgia]] and [[Unintentional weight loss]]
### Look for sources of bacteraemia:
#### [[IV drug use]], [[Cannula]], [[Central line]]
### There are classic (but rare) signs O/E:
#### [[Splinter haemorrhages]], [[Janeway's lesions]], [[Osler's nodes]], [[Roth spots]]
### Also look for concomittant infections:
#### [[Septic arthritis]]
## DDx:
### [[Acute bacterial infectious endocarditis]] with [[S. aureus]] can latch onto normal native valves 
### [[Subacute bacterial infective endocarditis]] with [[S. viridans]], [[S. aureus]], [[HACEK group]] attacks previously damaged native valves 
### [[Prosthetic valve endocarditis]] with [[S. epidermidis]], [[S. aureus]], [[S. viridans]] and  all can attack prosthetic mechanical or bio-valves
### [[Fungal endocarditis]] with [[Aspergillis]] and [[C. albicans|Candida]] attack normal valves of those that are [[Immunocompromised patient|immunocompromised]]
## Mimics:
### Other forms of [[Endocarditis]]
## Workup:
### Bedside
#### UA must be done to look for sequelae 
##### RBC casts -> glomerulonephritis
### Imaging
#### TTE vs TOE
##### Do TTE first usually
##### TOE always done first if prosthetic valves
### Labs
#### **Minimum of 3 blood cultures**
#### Elevated ESR and/or CRP usually present 
#### Most patients develop a normochromic normocytic anemia
#### WBC can be normal!
##### May have left shift -> towards neutrophils
### Diagnosis is made by Duke criteria
#### Combinations of major or minor criteria can be made to satisfy a diagnosis of infective endocarditis
Any of the following ways can satisfy Duke criteria:
1. 2 Major criteria
2. 1 major criteria + 3 minor criteria
3. 5 minor criteria

| Typical IE organisms found on 2 seperate blood cultures                        | Immunocomplex deposition signs -> Oslers nodes, glomerulonephritis, roth spots, +ve Rheumatoid factor |
| Persistent bacteraemia on blood cultures 12 hrs apart                          | Abnormal echo not meeting major criteria                                                              |

# Tx
## Principles of abx in endocarditis
- Duration of therapy sufficient to eradicate organisms growing within valvular vegetations
- During this duration, serum concentration must be continuously sufficiently high for sustained bactericidal effective

## Surgical Mx
### Consider in
#### Valvular failure leading to heart failure and severe LV dysfunction
#### Resistant organisms
#### Abscess or fistula formation
#### Large (>10mm), mobile vegetation

---
## Complications
### Infectious endocarditis begets [[Infective endocarditis]]
### Immune complex deposition -> Osler nodes, Roth spots, secondary [[Glomerulonephritis]]
