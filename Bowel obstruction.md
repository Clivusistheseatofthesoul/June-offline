## DDx:
### Can be divided into the region they affect -> although some aetiologies afflict both
#### [[Small bowel obstruction]]
#### [[Large bowel obstruction]]
### There are several forms of functional or adynamic obstruction -> not a mechanically obstructing cause 
#### Acute functional small (and large bowel) obstruction -> [[Ileus]]
#### Acute non-inflammatory functional isolated large bowel obstruction -> [[Ogilvies syndrome|Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction]]
#### Acute inflammatory functional isolated large bowel obstruction -> [[Megacolon|Toxic megacolon]]
#### Chronic functional small and large bowel obstruction -> [[Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction]]

The terminology of ileus, and pseudo obstruction here is confusing and very poorly classified semiotically. Historically ileus was used as a synonym for bowel obstruction: 
- Now ileus is only used to mean functional bowel obstruction (Anything thats not a physical big thing blocking the passage) when it affects both the small, or large bowel
	- Meconium ileus is actually a structural cause of bowel obstruction :/ 

Pseudo-obstruction historically refers solely to functional causes of large bowel obstruction.
- Now Pseudo-obstruction can mean 2 entirely different things! 
	1. Acute pseudo-obstruction (officially called Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction :/ even though theres no such thing as acute small bowel pseudo-obstruction) -> used to be called Ogilvie's syndrome -> and is isolated to the colon
	2. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction -> affects both small and large bowel but clinically manifests as small bowel obstruction

The additional confusion betwen Bowel obstruction, Pseudo-obstruction, Ileus and megacolon are relics of past medical terminology which mistakes disease the surgeon canno't see with the term non-organic disease.
