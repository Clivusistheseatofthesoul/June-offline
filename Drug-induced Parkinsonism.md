# Syndrome of [[Parkinsonism]] secondary to onset of effects of [[Anti-psychotics|Anti-psychotic]]
## Includes:
###  [[Akinesia|Bradykinesia]] occurs earliest -> [[Akinesia]] 
#### Reduced swallowing -> [[Sialorrhea]]
### The other features appear later, notably symptoms are **bilateral instead of unilateral**
#### [[Lead-pipe rigidity]]
#### Notable difference is that tremor is rare and when present either:
##### Perioral tremor -> [[Rabbit syndrome]]
##### **bilateral** [[Parkinsonian tremor|Pill-rolling tremor]] -> when combined with the hypertonia becomes -> [[Cog-wheel rigidity]]
##### Bring it out through hand movements on the contralateral side 
#### Sometimes [[Postural instability]] is included here
### Oftentimes this produces a particular gait pattern -> [[Parkinsonian gait]]

## Mimics:
### Other causes of parkinsonism
#### Chronic tardive dyskinesia 
## DDx:
### [[Anti-psychotics]]
#### Acute drug induced parkinsons
#### Subacute neuroleptic malignant syndrome

**Mechanism:** Degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons fo the #substantia_nigra_pars_compacta  result in inability of the direct pathway to correctly focus and filter movement programmes over the indirect pathways + acetycholinergic pathway
- this can be revealled through administration of dopamine antagonising drugs E.g [[Anti-psychotics|Anti-psychotic]]

# Tx
## Stop offending agent 
## Consider starting Anti-cholinergic
### [[Benzdripene]]
### Stop once movement disorder dissappears
## If parkinsonism does not dissappear months after stopping
### Assume reveal of underlying [[Parkinsonism]] of another aetiology
