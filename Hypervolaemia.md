## Includes:
### [[Rapid weight gain]], [[periorbital oedema]]
### [[Hypertension]], [[Elevated JVP]]
### [[Dyspnoea]], [[Pulmonary oedema]], [[Hepatomegaly]], [[Ascites]]
#### [[Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea]]
### [[Sacral oedema]], [[Ascending pitting oedema]]

## DDx:
### [[Iatrogenic fluid overload]]
### Hyperdynamic circulation -> [[CCF]], [[Chronic liver disease]], [[Chronic kidney disease]]
