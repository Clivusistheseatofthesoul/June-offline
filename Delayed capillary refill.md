# Pressing on distal phalanx blanches skin → letting go will reperfuse the distal capillary bed → restoring the tissue pink colour. A capillary refill of greater than 3s indicates arterial insufficiency
## Part of:
### [[Compartment syndrome]]
## DDx:
### Causes of 'systolic' 'umph' shock -> [[Hypovolaemic shock]], [[Cardiogenic shock]], [[Obstructive shock]]
### [[Hypovolaemia]] -> [[Hypovolaemic shock]]

Mechanism: Arterial insufficiency → reduced perfusion of periphery

Different diseases can cause arterial insufficiency in different ways:
1. Generalised arterial insufficiency
- dehydration
- Shock
- Widespread [[Peripheral vascular disease]]
- [[Acute heart failure]]
2. Localised arterial insufficiency -> **ALWAYS think** **[[Compartment syndrome]]** first
- if not -> localised [[Peripheral vascular disease]]
