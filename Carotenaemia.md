Mechanism: Either by excessive input, hyperlipidaemia mediated excessive beta-carotene absorption (by DM, hypothyroidism or by nephrotic syndrome) or reduced parenchymal output -> failure to convert carotene into vitamin A in the liver -> Carotenaemia → excess carotene deposition into the skin → yellow discolouration of pale areas (typically the palm)

Carotenaemia (more accurately, carotenoderma) is the deposition of excessive carotene into the skin due to excess circulating carotenoids.

- Carotenaemia is often confused with [[Jaundice]] and should be differentiated by looking for scleral icterus → which is not affected in carotenaemia but is yellow in Jaundice.

The determination of aetiology is important:

- R/O secondary carotenaemia before assuming carotenaemia due to excessive nutritional intake (primary carotenaemia):
- Primary carotenaemia although on its own is harmless -> **may be the initial presentation of an eating disorder**
