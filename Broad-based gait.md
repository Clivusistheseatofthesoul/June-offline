# A compensatory response to instability due to cerebellar dysfunction -> will not be able to perform tandem gait
## Part of:
### [[Gait ataxia]]

## DDx: 
### Causes of transient cerebellar dysfunction -> [[Alcohol intoxication]]
### Causes of cereropontine tract dysfunction -> [[Normal pressure hydrocephalus]]
### Causes of permenant intrinsic cerebellar dysfunction

Mechanism: Destructive lesion of the afferents into the, or intrinsically within the  vermal, flocculonodular lobes +/- lateral hemispheres of the cerebellum
