Aliases: Superventricular tachycardia

# [[Cardiac arrhythmias|Abnormally]] Fast heartrate caused by abnormal conduction above the ventricles
## Clinical features:
###
## DDx:
### [[Narrow complex tachycardias]] (<3 small squares)
#### [[AVNRT]], [[AVRT]], [[Atrial tachycardia]]
##### Sometimes [[AFlut]] and [[AFib]] included here if using anatomical classification
### [[Broad complex tachycardias]]
#### One of the above but with an additional Bundle branch block
#### One of the above with aberrancy
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Triage patients into stable or unstable
#### Unstable patients have any of the below
##### Chest pain, raised RR, hypotensive, poor perfusion or signs of cardiogenic shock, 
---
# Acute Tx
## All patients should be under continuous ECG monitering
## Tx of SVT in unstable patients
### Synchronised cardioversion under sedation or GA
#### Done at the same time as the R wave

## Tx of SVT in haemodynamically stable patients
#### Attempt non-pharmacological cardioversion first
##### [[Valsalva manoeuvre]]
##### [[Carotid sinus massage]]
#### If those fail try:
##### [[Adenosine]]
##### If adenosine is contraindicated use -> [[Verapamil]]

# Tx of recurrent EVT episodes
## these can be managed medically
### Beta-blocker, CCB, amiodarone
## Or they can be RF-ablated
