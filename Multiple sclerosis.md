# [[CNS demyelinating disease]] characterised by episodic relapsing remitting episodes of focal neurologic signs
## Clinical features: Relapsing remitting pattern of lesions due to plaques which can occur sequentially or simultaneously
### [[Unilateral optic neuritis]]
### [[Transverse myelitis]] ->  [[Transverse myelitis]] -> typically sensory only with [[Brown-SÃ©quard syndrome]], [[Sensory level]], [[Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia]] or [[LUTS]]
### Episodes are worsened by heat -> [[Uhtoff's phenomenon]]
### Paresthesias bought about by flexion of cord -> [[Lhermitte's sign]]
## DDx:
###
## Mimics:
### NMOSD and MOGAD

## Workup:
### Lab battery
#### Mimic r/o
 Lyme antibody, B12, HIV, ANA/ENA, ACE, rarely HTLV-1

# Tx
## Any acute relapse, regardless of plaque location is treated with high dose IV steroid to shorten relapse duration
### IV 500mg methylprednisolone daily for 5 days
### Steroids only shorten duration and do not predict return to baseline function
## Chronic DMT

#### Amantadine with Mindfulness and CBT 
### Chronic spasticity 
#### Baclofen and gabapentin 
### Urinary Sx
