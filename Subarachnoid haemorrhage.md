Aliases: SAH

# Bleeding into the subarachnoid space due to rupture of the superficial CNS vessels 
## Clinical features:
### [[Thunderclap headache]] usually with [[Nausea and vomiting]] ± [[Meningism]]
### Oftentimes [[Suspected Vertigo]]
### Most often precipitated by sudden movement or cause of paroxysmal hypertension
#### [[Phaeochromocytoma]]
#### [[Acute Emotional distress]]
## DDx:
### Ruptured aneurysm -> Aneurysmal SAH -> [[Berry aneurysm]]
### Ruptured [[CNS AVM]]
### Just from [[TBI|head trauma]] alone
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### noncon CT head with thin cuts through the base of the brain
#### This is to increase the sensitivity to small amounts of blood
### Only if this is -ve AND -ve for mass lesions do you follow with LP
---
# Tx
## Prevent further vasospasm and subsequent ischaemia
### PO [[Nimodipine]]

---
## Complications
### Subsequent vasospasm days after SAH -> Focal neurologic deficit
### If they survive -> [[Chronic arachnoiditis]] -> [[Normal pressure hydrocephalus]]

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology

---
#### Cases
Some cases are thought to arise from hypertension secondary to acutely distressing events, oftentimes in those without overt aneurysm
>  Thus a woman answered the door to a policeman who told her that the woman next door, her closest friend, had hanged herself: she said ‘Oh, my God’ and forthwith had her haemorrhage. Another woman was watching television when an aeroplane on a test flight was shown exploding in the air; she believed (erroneously as it turned out) that her son was on it, put her hands to her head and had the haemorrhage within seconds of the disaster. Another had a subarachnoid haemorrhage within a minute of being told by her husband that he knew of her adultery and was going to divorce her.
