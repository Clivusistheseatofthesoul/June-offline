## Clinical features:
### Onset of first [[Psychosis|Psychotic break]] around young age precipitated by a stressor
#### Typically by:
##### When they first leave home
##### Childbirth 
### Duration of 'odd behavior and speech' which narrows from psychosis ddx, and r/o schizophrenia mimics
|          | [[Brief psychotic disorder]] | [[Schizophreniform disorder]] | [[Schizophrenia]]        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Duration | 1 day - 1 month              | 1 month - 6 months            | > 6 months               |
| Tx       | 1 month of anti-psychotics   | 3-6 months of anti-psychotics | Lifelong anti=psychotics |
#### There is nothing qualitatively different between schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia -> it is just there to help you decide whether you need to medicate for life
##### If the psychosis persists after stopping the treatment after 6 months -> likely going to be full blown [[Schizophrenia]]
### Presence of disordered mood 
## DDx:
### If occuring < 3 weeks after childbirth -> [[Puerperal psychosis|Post-partum psychosis]]
### Could still be [[Schizophrenia]] you won't know until you try taking away the medication after 6 months
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
