#  Ipsilateral ptosis, non reactive mydriasis, eyeball down and out
## Description:
### If full -> they will not report diplopia becuase of the complete ptosis
### Ipsilateral [[Unilateral Ptosis]], [[Unilateral blown pupil]]
### Eyeball down and out
## Part of:
### [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]], [[Orbital apex syndrome]], [[Uncal herniation syndrome]], [[Weber syndrome]]
## DDx:
### with [[Altered mental status]] progressing towards [[Coma]] -> [[Uncal herniation syndrome]]
### Within the basilar area:
#### severe acute onset[[Raised ICP headache]] -> [[PcommA aneurysm]]
#### Multiple C.Ns affected, meningeal signs -> basilar [[Meningitis]], [[Meningovascular syphillis]]
### Nuclear/fasicular lesion -> [[Weber syndrome]]
### Painful, oculomotor palsy **without pupil effects** -> is almost always due to mononeuritis multiple from [[T2DM]] or [[T1DM]]

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion most commonly due to compression or ischaemic damage to the oculomotor nerve

Severeal different aetiologies can cause the 'Hutchinson's pupil' → aka Non-reactive blown pupil. They all cause it by ipsilateral damage to CN III

- **PCommA aneurysm** → pushing against the CN III at the exit points from the interpeduncular fossa
- **Supratentorial increased ICP** (may be from massive MCA+ACA hemispheric stroke → massive cerebral oedema ) → uncal herniation → compression of CN III often the only sign is the 'Hutchinson's pupil'
- Peripheral microvascular infarction of CN III → diabetic mononeuropathy causing vasculopathy of the vasa nervorum
- Aseptic or septic thrombi within the cavernous sinus → cavernous sinus syndrome affecting CN III,IV,V,VI
