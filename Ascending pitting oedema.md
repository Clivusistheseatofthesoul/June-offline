# Oedema that stays in when pushed starting from the distal lower limb and accumulating upwards.
## Part of:
### [[Hypervolaemia]], [[Nephrotic syndrome]]

## DDx:
### Hyperdynamic circulation -> [[CCF]], (RHS failure causes more severe pitting oedema than LHS failure) [[Chronic kidney disease]], [[Chronic liver disease]]
### causes of [[Hypoalbuminaemia]] -> [[Nephrotic syndrome]], [[protein losing enteropathy]]
### drugs causing sodium retention -> [[diuretics]], [[fludrocortisone]], [[NSAIDs]]
### drigs increasing global capillary permeabiltiy -> [[vascular specific CCBs]]
### Paraneoplastic -> [[ACTH-oma]]

---
Mechanism: Global fluid overload or fluid overload of the internal organs (hyperdynamic circulation) causing backlog of pressure from the RHS heart -> RHS heart failure or in congestive heart failure
