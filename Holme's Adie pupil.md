Aliases: Tonic pupils
---
# At rest a dilated regular asymmetric pupil which at testing reveals a light-near dissociation 
## Accompanied by:
### [[Knee reflex (absent)]], [[Anhydriasis]]
## DDx:
### Idiopathic -> r/o alternatives first like Argyll-Robertson pupils

Mechanism: Unknown cause -> suspected to be a benign pos-viral syndrome 
Seen in: #Neuro

Holme's-Adie pupils unlike Argyll-Robertson's are **always circular** I.e regular in shape
- if there is still any confusion -> slit lamp examination of the pupil will reveal wriggling and undulating movements of the edge of the iris in bright light

# Cases:
- H-A pupils can present suprisingly acutely -> A 41-year-old research scientist, specializing in visual pathway mechanisms, was involved in experimentation on his own eyes on a daily basis. He arrived at his laboratory one morning having developed a classic Holmes-Adie pupil **overnight** -> his occupation  precluded any possibility that this had developed slowly
