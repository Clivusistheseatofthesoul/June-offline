# Diarrhoea that has occured for <2 weeks so far -> could potentially be an aetiology which causes an acute or chronic diarrhoea
## Part of:
### [[Acute dysentery]]
## DDx: Find acute causes then move to causes of chronic diarrhoea
### Acute diarrhoea is mostly infectious in aetiology
#### Viral causes (30-40%) of gastroenteritis -> [[Norovirus]]
#### Bacterial causes (30%) of gastroenteritis can be split into two syndromic presentations -> [[Rapid onset watery diarrhoea]] [[Acute dysentery]]
##### Toxigenic bacteria premake toxins which cause a **secretory diarrhoea** -> [[Rapid onset watery diarrhoea]]
##### Other bacteria colonize, adhere, and invade the mucosa -> inflammation and haemorrhage -> [[Acute dysentery]]
#### Parasitic causes of gastroenteritis
#### Ano-receptive intercourse -> STI-pathogen induced -> 
### The most common non-infectious acute diarrhoea causes are:
#### [[Ileus]]
#### Drug toxicity 
##### [[Organophosphate ingestion]] -> [[Cholinergic toxicity]]
##### [[Magnesium]]
#### Drug withdraw -> [[Opiod withdrawal]]
