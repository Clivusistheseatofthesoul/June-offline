## Clinical features:
### Most present as gradual [[Chronic liver disease]]
#### [[Jaundice]] with [[Secondary Amenorrhea]]
### 25% will present as acute hepatitis
#### [[Painful jaundice]] esp with [[RUQ pain]], [[Hepatomegaly]] and a fever
## DDx:
### Depends on the type of antibody
|                        | **Type I**                 | **Type II**                  | **Type III**                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Patient group          | Both adults and children   | Children only                | Middle age adults            |
| Autoantibodies present | ANA and Anti-smooth muscle | Anti-liver/kidney microsomal | Soluble liver-kidney antigen | 





Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and/or anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA)  
  
Affects both adults and children  

Anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies (LKM1)  
  
Affects children only  

Soluble liver-kidney antigen  
  
Affects adults in middle-age
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Labs
#### LFTs
#### Elevated serum globulins -> typically IgG
#### Autoimmune screen
##### ANA, Anti-smooth muscle, Anti-liver/kidney microsomal etc
### Definitively diagnosed on biopsy
####
