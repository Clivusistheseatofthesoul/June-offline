There are 4 main systems to accomplish eye movements
1. Saccades
	1. [Horizontal](https://umich.app.box.com/s/xvmcj6megaxdnbgi73hx8gtm9quk17cl/file/452794253021)
		- Afferrent input of object in contralateral field
			- V1 -> dorsal stream -> parietal-occipital junction -> FEF
			- FEF -> anterior limb IC -> *decussates* -> contralateral PPRF
				- lesion: saccades towards contralateral field will be slow, incomplete or altogether absent
					- if parietal lobe lesion -> deviation of default conjugate gaze away from contralteral field (i.e ipsilaterally towards lesion) -> oftentimes seen in motor hemispatial neglect syndrome where the eyes just dont want to look towards the left
				- But this person will have intact VOR triggered by oculocephalic maneuver
					- These 2 signs together are called a **horizontal supranuclear gaze palsy** (typically cuased by FEF or parietal lesion)
			- Contralateral PPRF -> contralateral abducens nucleus
				- Lesion: saccades towards contralateral field will be slow, incomplete or altogether absent
					-  these 2 are quite close together so often damaged together
				- This person will additionally not be able to look even with VOR triggered by oculocephalic maneuver
					- PPRF itself is lesions along with that abducens nucleus
					- These 2 signs together are called **pontine gaze palsy**
				- Bilateral lesion: saccades slow regardless of looking towards left or right
					- **Eyes in molasses** -> oftentimes SCA
			- Contralateral abducens facicles -> CN VI
				- Lesion: 6th nerve palsy
					- Regardless of which system is used they cannot look towards that side and if severe -> ipsilateral esotropia
					- Differentiate between facicles and 6th nerve by:
						- facicles will have ataxia, nystagmus, hemiparesis due to it being in the pontine bridge
			- Contralateral PPRF -> *decussates back* -> up the ipsilateral MLF ->  
				- Lesion: inability to adduct when contralateral PPRF activated to foveate towards that side
					- This is best seen with saccades and NOT pursuit
					- subtle INO -> adduction will be slow but not complete failure
				- This is called a **Internuclear opthalmoplegia**
				- If both both PPRF/abducens AND ipsilateral MLF lesioned:
					- PPRF lesion = They cannot look towards side of lesion at all 
					- ipsilateral MLF = when contralateral PPRF activated to drag eyes over -> the ipsilateral eye dosent budge
					- This is called **One and a half syndrome**
			- Ipsilateral oculomotor nucleus
		- End product: you look towards the new object in contralateral field -> i.e you *foveate*
			- Gaze maintained by:
				- contralateral PPRF -> neural intergrators: medial vestibular nucleus <-> nucleus prepositus hypoglossi -> pump maintaince tonic signal to PPRF
				- overcomes elastic forces and resets new gaze
					- Lesion: **Gaze evoked nystagmus** when looking towards the side of lesion where the fast phase is temporal and towards the object
				- crosstalk with cerebellar flocularnodular lobe + vermis to maintain foveation
					- Lesion: Centripetal saccades aka **Ocular dysmetria** where there are saccades of reducing amplitude which get closer to foveating the object
	2. Vertical
		- Afferent input of object *from both hemispheres* either driven bottom up or top down
			- Bottom up: Bilateral V1 -> dorsal stream -> bilateral parietoccipital junction -> bilateral FEF
			- Top down: Bilateral FEF directly -> bilateral parietoccipital junction
			- FEF + parietoccipital junction -> SC -> rostral interstitial nucleus of MLF
				- lesion: saccades up or down will be slow, incomplete or altogether absent
				- But this person will have intact VOR triggered by oculocephalic maneuver
					- These 2 signs together are called a **Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy** (typically cuased by PSP)
			- Rostral interstitial nucleus of MLF <-> Interstitial nucleus of Cajal (both in midbrain)
			- Each RiMLF has bilateral innervation (via *posterior commissure*) of the SR and IR subnuclei of the oculomotor nucleus lower down in the midbrain -> activate both to generate the upwards saccade
				- Lesion: permenant downgaze -> **Sunset eyes** with **Convergence retraction nystagmus**
					- Again the 'nystagmus' is seen best with vertical saccades
					- Most obvious using the optokinetic strip test
						- upwards movement -> normal jerk nystagmus alone
						- downwards movement -> eyes actually jerk *backwards* -> retraction
						- this is due to cocontractionf of all EOM -> due to 'miswiring of dorsal midbrain'
			- Each RiMLF also uses a *ventral tegmental midbrain path* to get to trochlear nucleus lower down in midbrain -> activate IR and SO to generate downwards saccade
				- lesion: **Conjugate downgaze paresis** and if severe conjugate upgaze deviation
					- midbrain tegmental lesion
					- rare -> typically caused by stroke
		- End product: You look upwards or downwards with both eyes
			- Gaze maintained by:
				- neural intergrator: RiMLF <-> Interstitial nucelus of Cajal -> pump maintaince tonic signal to RiMLF
				- overcomes elastic forces and resets new gaze
2. Pursuit
	1. Horizontal
		-  uses temporal occipital junction instead of parieto-occipital junction 
		- Same thing but goes through DL pontine nuclei -> cerebellum -> horizontal neural integrator -> directly to 6th nerve nucleus and bypasses PPRF -> also uses same MLF to get to 3rd nerve nucleus
	2. Vertical
		- leaves both cerebral hemispheres -> goes directly to SR/IR and 4th nerve nuclei avoiding the RiMLF
	- Lesions anywhere in this massive pathway result in **Omnidirectional jerky pursuit**
		- these are catchup saccades as the more robust saccadic system likely has intact components
		- this is a non-localising but *sensitive* sign of brain dysfunction
	- **Unidirectional pursuit deficit** are very rare but possible
		- Unidirectional horizontal pursuit deficit -> severe massive *ipsilateral* parietal lobe lesion
			- if you had a right parietal lobe lesion -> only right pursuit is choppy
			- typically caused by parietal encephalomalacia
3. Vergence
	- Afferent input of object to both hemispheres where there is *mismatch in images* -> 'momentary double vision'
		- Poor vision during childhood -> blurry vision -> lots of mismatch images despite things being actually correctly aligned -> activation of convergence center or inhibition of convergence center inappropriately -> exotropia or esotropia
		- Convergence neurons will overreact or underreact and primed differently
	- Early visual cortex -> mismatch neurons -> tegmental midbrain convergence center (near MR nuclei)
		- Lesion directly to projection into convergence center
			- differentials are broad E.g any inflammatory condition, fever, sleep deprivation, hallucinogens, raised ICP, any encephalopathy
	- Convergence center -> bilateral MR nuclei -> converge eyes
		- Lesion to tegmental midbrain
	- Note all will cause **comitant esotropia** or **exotropia** -> revealed by **cover testing**
4. VOR
