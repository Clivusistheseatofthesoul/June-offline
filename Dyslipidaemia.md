# Term for a whole bunch of disorders associated with changes in total levels or ratios of lipid transporters in blood
## Includes:
### Hypercholesterolaemia (elevated total cholesterol)
#### reduced HDL, elevated LDL
### [[Hypertriglyceridaemia]]
### Others include: elevated LP(a)
## DDx:
### Hypercholesterolaemia
#### Primary hypercholesterolaemia
##### [[Familial hypercholesterolaemia]], Polygenic hypercholesterolaemia, Familial combined hypercholesterolaemia
#### Secondary hypercholesterolaemia 
##### Endocrine -> [[Hypothyroidism]], [[T2DM]]
##### Hepatic -> Cholestatic diseases E.g [[Primary billary cirrhosis]]
##### Drug induced -> [[Cyclosporine]], [[Carbamezapine]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Lookout for the [[Metabolic syndrome]] phenotype with -> [[T2DM]], [[NAFLD]], [[Central adiposity]], [[Hypertension]]

### Assess risk for vascular events using one of the risk calculators E.g Framingham risk score -> give you an absolute risk of CVD

# Tx
## Prevention of dyslipidaemic complications is dose-dependent with duration of time with low LDL
### If you have the inherited PCSK9 mutation you get maximum lifetime risk reduction of 80% relative to normal population
## If Low-moderate absolute CVD risk score -> Lifestyle intervention for 6 months
## If refractory or meets criteria -> Certain paitents will benefit from [[Statin]]
### [[Statin#Indications]]
## Those who only have isolated hypertriglyceridaemia will benefit from [[Fibrates]] -> Fibrates + fishoil -> [[Niacin]] and/or serum apheresis
## Target lipid levels
| Component         | Target level                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| LDL               | Primary prevention < 2.0; Secondary prevention < 1.8 |
| HDL               | > 1.0                                                |
| Total cholesterol | < 2.5                                                |
| TAGs              | < 2.0                                                      |
## If levels still do not meet target -> add on [[PCSK9 inhibitor]] or [[Ezetimibe]]

# Consequences
---
## Complications
### LDL buildup -> [[Atherosclerosis]]

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
Too much intake -> increased LDL -> not enough HDL to bring peripheral cholesterol back -> cholesterol gets stuck peripherally -> builds up -> [[Atherosclerosis]]
