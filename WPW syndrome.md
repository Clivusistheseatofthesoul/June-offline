# 
## Clinical features:
###
### [[Sudden cardiac death]]
## DDx:
### Most patietns have otherwise normal hearts ~70%
### Systemic diseases -> [[Tuberous sclerosis]]
### [[Ebstein's anomaly]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### ECG
#### [[Short PR interval]]
#### [[Wide QRS complex]] with [[Delta wave]]
### TOE
#### Looking for concommitant congenital heart defect
#### and to evaluate total heart function 
### Electrophysiology
#### Can locate the accessory pathway

---
# Tx
## Curative treatment with RF Ablation is first line
### Relatively low risk
#### Main complication (~1%) -> complete heart block -> rendering the patient completely pacemaker dependent
## Medical therapy can successfully prevent abnormal rhythm

---
## Complications
### Accessory pathways can make a concomitant SVT become *aberrant*
#### If Another SVT or [[AFib]]/[[AFlut]] occurs -> conduction through accessory pathway directly triggers [[Ventricular fibrillation]] without RVR (Afib/Aflut with aberrancy) -> [[Sudden cardiac death]]

---
## Aetiology

## Pathophysiology
### Congenital anomaly of prescence of abnormal conduction which do not seperate during embryogenesis resulting in remnant accessory pathway between atrium and ventricles 
#### Types of accessory pathways
##### Atrioventricular 
##### Mahaim fibers
##### Atrionodal
##### Atrio-Hisian
### Pre-excitation of ventricles -> re-activation of atria before SA node activates -> re-entrant circuit -> [[AVRT]]
### Relay of non-AVRT arrythmias through the accessory pathway directly to the ventricles -> Afib with aberrancy, Aflut with aberrancy
