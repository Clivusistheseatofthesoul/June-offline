# Altered bowel habit such that it is either: less often (typically <3 per week), difficulty defacating, stools are firm and pellet like
## Part of:
### [[Hypothyroidism]], [[Shy-Drager Syndrome]]

## DDx:
### Younger patient -> Congenital causes:
#### [[Hirchsprung's disease]]
### Acute onset -> likely organic cause:
#### [[Diverticulitis]], [[Volvulus]]
### Older patient 50+ -> [[Colorectal cancer]]
### MedHx can reveal medically induced constipation
#### [[Opiods]], [[NSAIDs]], [[diuretics]], [[CCBs]]
### MedHx with Cation-containing agents
#### [[Antacid]], [[Iron supplementation]], [[Ca supplementation]]
### MedHx with [[Anti-cholinergics|Anti-cholinergic]] properties:
#### [[Anti-depressants]], [[Anti-psychotics]], [[levo-DOPA]], [[Anti-histamines]]
### Chronic course with absence of red-flags -> functional causes
#### Elderly with dysautonomia -> [[Shy-Drager Syndrome]]
#### [[Dehydration]], [[inadequate fibre intake]]
#### **Dx OF EXCLUSION** -> Constipation or constipation with diarrhoea -> screen for [[Anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder]] -> [[IBS]]
