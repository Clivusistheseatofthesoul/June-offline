# Visual defect towards one half of the visual field and destruction of central vision -> will present with conscious noticing of abscence of poor vision + 'bumping to things on one side'
## Part of: 
### [[Homonymous hemianopia]]
## DDx: Split central vision -> post-chiasmatic from peduncle of optic radiation to common optic radiation lesions
### Parieto-occipital [[Glioma]] can also compress the common optic radiation 

---
Mechanism: Destructive lesion at certain post-LGN locations: #optic_peduncle and #Common_optic_radiation
- Optic peduncle (trunk of both the optic radiations) is vascularised by: #PCA -> #thalamo_geniculate_arteries of the PCA
- The common optic radiation in the deep white matter of the parieto-occipito-temporal junction is vascularised by: #ICA -> #MCA
Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia
