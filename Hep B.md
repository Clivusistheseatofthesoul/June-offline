# Summary
-   Escherichia coli is a normal component of the gut flora
    -   Initially, overwhelming expansion can cause diarrhoea with O157:H7 EHEC causing severe, haemorrhaagic and watery diarrhoea + Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
    -   when given the opportunity for expansion it can invade into surrounding mucosal and epidermal surfaces causing → UTI, Ascending cholangitis → eventually to distant organs which are **life-threatening** → Neonatal meningitis
    -   HepB is a DNA virus loop with an interesting structure composed of multiple overlapping open reading frames 
		-   Intergrated into the genome of host cells -> very hard to treat and eliminate from body
	
# Aetiology
## Spread
### Most spread occurs vertically from infected mother to child during childbirth
#### Occurs during and before the clinical [[Acute hepatitis]]
### Sexual transfer and [[IV drug use|IVDU]] is also possible
## Pathogenicity

---
# Clinical manifestations
## Only causes [[Acute hepatitis]] -> does not cause [[Chronic hepatitis]]
### However in the elderly it does cause -> [[Fulminant hepatic failure]]
## [[Chronic hepatitis]] -> [[Chronic liver disease]] AND [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]]

# Dx
## Acute infection -> search for 3 specific things
### HBV DNA in blood
### HB-e Antigen -> envelope antigen from actual virus when infected
### **Anti HB-c IgM Abs** -> antibodies against the core 
### HB-s Antigen is always positive in those infected in any form by the virus
## Chronic infection -> search for abscence and prescence of certain things
### HBV DNA may still be in blood
### HB-e Antigen will still be in blood -> envelope antigen from actual virus when infected
### **There are no Anti-HB-c IgMs**
### HB-s Antigen is always positive in those harboring the virus in any form
## Inactive carrier 
### HBV DNA may still be in blood in tiny amounts
### **There is no HB-e Antigen** -> no longer infected
### **There are no Anti-HB-c IgMs**
### HB-s Antigen is always positive in those harboring the virus in any form
## Recovered 
### HBV DNA will **no longer be in the blood**
### **There is no HB-e Antigen** -> no longer infected
#### However they will have antibodies to HB-e which destroyed the virus
### **There are no Anti-HB-c IgMs**
### **There is no more HB-s Antigen** -> because they no longer harbor the virus
## Vaccinated
### HBV DNA will **not be in the blood**
### **There is no HB-e Antigen** -> never infected with actual virus
#### They will not have HB-e antibodies because they were never infected with the real virus
### **There are no Anti-HB-c IgMs**
### **There is no more HB-s Antigen** -> because they no longer harbor the virus
#### **However** they will have abx to the HB-s from the vaccine

# Tx 
## Acute treatment
### Pegylated interferons
### Anti-virals
#### Entecavir and Tenofovir
#### Indicated even in early cirrhosis -> reduce fibrosis and stabalises disease
## Primary prevention with HepB vaccine in neonates
### Provide to infected mothers reduces transmission rate from 10% to 2% 
#### Household contacts of epidemic
#### Travellers to asia, african subcontinent and south america

# Tx in pregnant women
## If both envelope and surface antigen +ve -> 50-70% vertical transmission risk
### Caesarean to avoid transmission
