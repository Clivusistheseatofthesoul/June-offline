# Acute onset transient dysrhthmic, flailing jerking movements **isolated to a limb** 
## Includes:
### Focal clonic jerks of a unilateral limb with the notable absence of Jacksonian march, and sparing of the facial muscles 
### Often brought about by postural change 
### Contralateral [[Cartoid bruit]] from [[Carotid artery stenosis]]
## DDx:
### [[TIA]]

---
Mechanism: Transient focal ischaemia of the motor cortex causing jerking movements of the contralateral limb which does not spread like an epileptogenic focus -> almost invariably caused by a high-grade #ICA stenosis 
Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia

Limb shaking syndrome or limb shaking TIA is often mistaken for a focal motor seizure producing acute onset clonic movements of a unilateral arm. Based on history alone we can differentiate the two:
- associated with orthostatic posture -> reducing CNS perfusion pressure
