A primary haemorrhage into the cerebellum pro- duces its lethal effect by brainstem distortion. Surgical evacuation offers a significant chance of recovery and prompt diagnosis is critical. The onset is acute, with sudden occipital headache, vomiting and ataxia. Within a variable period consciousness becomes impaired, with the onset of gaze palsies, bilateral pyramidal signs and periodic respiration. Death will follow rapidly unless surgical evacuation of the clot is attempted. The clinical picture can mimic a subarachnoid haemorrhage and the risk of a diagnostic lumbar puncture in this precari- ous situation is only too obvious. This particular syn- drome is also a frequent presentation of a 'benign' cerebellar haemangioblastoma, and examples of this condition are included in Chapters 7 and 12.
