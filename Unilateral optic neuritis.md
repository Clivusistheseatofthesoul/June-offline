# Inflammation of a unilateral optic nerve
## Clinical features:
### Painful eye which is worse on movement -> [[Painful opthalmoplegia]]
#### Typically lasts 3-5 days -> if not, suspect other causes
###   [[Unilateral Central scotoma]] or generalised peripheral field constriction  with [[RAPD]]
#### SHowing [[Uhtoff's phenomenon]] -> Worse with excercise/in the shower
#### Very rarely can get altitudinal loss
### Retrobulbar neuritis oftentimes produces a central vision defect described as a 'fluffy ball', a 'puff of smoke', a 'steamed-up window' or a sensation as if 'looking through ground glass', and often claim that if they could 'see round it' vision would be normal -> [[Red pin test]] may persist after episode

## Part of:
### [[Optic neuritis]]
## DDx:
### [[Multiple sclerosis]], and other CNS demyelinating disease like [[NMOSD]]
### Leptomeningeal disease, Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, [[Neurosarcoidosis]]

## Mimics:
### Temporal arteritis -> secondary ischaemic optic neuritis
#### look for optic disk oedema and haemorrhages (always present in ischaemic neuritis
### Optic nerve compression 
#### look for Junctional scotoma -> quadrantanopia in contralateral eye
### Migranous neuralgia
