Can be clinically subdivided into two depending on the location within the temporal lobe:

- Medial temporal lobe seizure

    Several seizure types are common here

    - Cognitive seizures with dejavu and/or jamais vu
    - Emotional seizures with fear or anger/aggression
    - Olfactor or gustatory sensory seizures (of typically unpleasant affect)

    These seizures can occur alone or in conjunction with associated features:

    - behavioral arrest with progressive impairment of awareness
    - oral automatisms
    - manual automatisms
    - Autonomic phenomena

    Evolution into a secondary general bilateral tonic-clonic seizure is uncommon

- Lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe seizue

    Typically auditory sensory seizure type:

    - focal sensory auditory seizure
        - sound in one ear localises to the contralateral hemisphere

    These seizures have associated features that contrast it with mesial temporal seizures

    - more rapid impairment of awareness (initial aware period not long)
    - shorter overall duration
    - quite rapidly spread â†’ may have motor features
        - Facial twitching or grimacing
        - contralateral upper limb dystonia
        - ipsilateral gaze deviation

    Evolution into secondary general bilateral tonic clonic seizures is **more common.**
