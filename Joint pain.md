# Ouch my joint hurty hurt -> presentation with [[Arthralgia]]
---
# Approach
## Acute Onset
### Acute, inflammated joint -> from i was compeltely fine to sudden loss of movement
#### Trauma, infection ([[Septic arthritis]]), crystals and reactive -> dx by [[Joint aspirate]] from Arthrocentesis
## Chronic, insidious onset -> Needs further evaluation into hot or cold
### Chronic cold joint pain -> [[Osteoarthritis]] -> XRay the joint
### Chronic hot joint pain -> one vs multiple joints
#### If only one joint invovled with chronic onset -> most likely flare of one of the acute inflammed joint problems (see above)
#### If multiple hot joints chronically involved -> Inflammatory arthritises -> ANA, RF and CCP serology Â± dsDNA, histone, centromere and topoisomerase if suspecting [[SLE]] and [[Systemic sclerosis]]
##### [[Seropositive arthropathy]] -> [[Rheumatoid arthiritis]], [[SLE]]
##### [[Seronegative arthorpathy]] -> [[Spondyloarthropathies]]
##### Other [[Connective tissue diseases]]

# DDx:
## Monoarticular: [[Osteoarthritis]], Trauma
## Oligoarticular (1-3): Septic, crystal, seronegative arthropathies
### Infectious -> [[Gonorrhoea]] causing [[Disseminated gonoccocal infection]] , [[S. aureus]]
### Crystal -> [[Gout]], [[Pseudogout]]
### Seronegative -> *PEAR*
#### [[Psoriatic arthiritis]], [[Enteropathic arthiritis]], [[Ankylosing spondylitis]], [[Reactive arthiritis]]
## Polyarticular (3+): *viruses. SSSSSS*
### Actual viruses -> [[Hep B]], [[Hep C]]
### Seronegative arthropathy can also be polyarticular
### Seropositive -> [[RA]], [[SLE]]
### Syphillis from [[T. pallidum]]
### [[Sarcoidosis]]
### [[Still's disease]]
### [[Sepsis]]
