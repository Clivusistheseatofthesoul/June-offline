# Severe miosis i.e Bilateral pupils less than 2mm in diameter → hence 'pinpoint'
## DDx:
### [[Opiod toxicity]]
### [[Pontine haemorrhage]] typically [[Primary pontine haemorrhage]]

Mechanism: Binding to central k1 receptors, or disruption to sympathetic nervous activity to both eyes.
Seen in: CNS, Drug toxicity, haemorrhage
Sign: 

Pinpoint pupils can be caused by normal aging.

- Pupils will symmetrically have reduced size and decreased mydriatic response in low light conditions

Pinpoint pupils can also be caused by life-threatening causes:

- Opiod OD → binding to kappa1 receptors
- Primary pontine haemorrhage: caused by hypertension → degenerative changes to arteriolar walls: Lipohyalinosis + fibrinoid necrosis + microaneurysms → haemorrhage disrupts descending first order UMNs
