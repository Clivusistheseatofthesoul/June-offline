# COPD
## Clinical features:
### If an acute [[COPD exacerbation]] -> [[Wheezing]], [[wet cough]]
### Pink puffers from emphysema
#### Prolonged straining expiration through pursed lips
##### wasting everywhere else that isnt intercostal muscle -> Pulmonary cachexia secondary to metabolic demand -> increased AP diameter or 'barrel chest'
##### O/E -> [[Match sign]], Hyper-resonant chest percussion with **absent liver dullness** 
#### Abscence of cyanosis but prescence of CO2 retention
### Blue bloaters from chronic bronchitis
#### [[Central cyanosis]] with [[Peripheral cyanosis]] in an oedmatous individual
#### Chronic productive cough for > 3 months for more than 2 years
##### O/E -> low pitch wheeze 
## DDx:
### Causes of Emphysema
#### [[Cigarette smoke]], Fuel aerosol exposure, [[Alpha1 anti-trypsin deficiency]]
## Mimics:
### Asthma -> Reverses obstructive picture with salbutamol 
### CCF -> can have a wheeze but caused by pulmonary oedema
### Bronchiectasis -> cupsfull of sputum 
## Workup:
### Eliminate mimics with
#### CXR, ABG, ECG where relevant -> these do not diagnose COPD but will eliminate things that look similar 
### PFTs -> spirometry
#### obstructive picture with no reversibility to SABA
##### Bronchodilator response is >12% and > 200 mLs -> although this should be interpreted in contex of the history
##### Substantial variation across readings (FEV1 variation > 400mL) when not exacerbating -> required for ICS

# Tx
## COPD severity is graded by FEV1 and exacerbation CAT score

|                                                                                   | CAT < 10                                         | CAT > 10                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 50 < FEV1 < 80 OR 1 or less exacerbations which did not require admission         | Group A -> mild symptoms, low exacerbation risk  | Group B -> Severe symptoms, low exacerbation risk  |
| 30 < FEV1 < 50 OR 2 or more exacerbations OR any exacerbation requiring admission | Group C -> mild symptoms, high exacerbation risk | Group D -> Severe symptoms, high exacerbation risk |
### Column determined by CAT score
### Square is determined by either the FEV1 values or by number of exacerbations a year (whichever is higher)
### Only CAT scores > 10 indicate prescription of ICS conditional to eosinophillia
|                                                                                   | CAT < 10                                                       | CAT > 10                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 50 < FEV1 < 80 OR 1 or less exacerbations which did not require admission         | Group A -> SABA or SAMA sufficient                             | Group B -> A + LAMA or LABA chronic bronchodilation |
| 30 < FEV1 < 50 OR 2 or more exacerbations OR any exacerbation requiring admission | Group C -> If asthma like features add [[ICS]] if not combine LAMA + LABA | Group D -> fire everything                          |
### Only patients asthma like features will benefit from ICS -> Start LABA + ICS
#### PMHx asthma or atopy
#### Serum eosinophils > 300 on FBC 
#### Substantial variation in FEV1 over time (at least 400 ml)
#### Worsening dyspnoea at night -> diurnal variation in peak expiratory flow (at least 20%)
### Oral corticosteroids are **never** used as maintainence therapy

## Reduce mortality
### The only 3 things which reduce mortality in COPD is: **O2, influenza vaccination and smoking cessation**
## Manage *COPD-ER*
### Corticosteroids
#### ICS -> oral corticosteroids is only a lasts resort to  accelerate getting someone out of a ditch during inpatient exacerbation control
#### Bone density should be checked annually
### O2
#### Target is SpO2 88-92% chronically -> acute removal of hypoxic drive is OK provided it will get them out of a ditch -> but chronically 88-92% is the goal
##### Mechansim: Chronic hypercapnia -> lost Co2 drive -> losing o2 drive only to breath -> if increased O2 isolated -> thye just stop breathing
- hypoxic vasoconstriction is actually useful in early COPD -> diverts blood away from deadspace -> removing hypoxia further increases your V/Q mismatch
### Prevention
#### Smoking cessation (and O2) are the only things which reduce mortality in diagnosed COPD
#### Prevent exacerbation with influenza and [[Pneumococcal vaccine]]
### Dilators
#### LAMA and LABA -> add on PDE4 inhibitors 
### Experimental
#### Some pulmonary one way valves which can be implanted -> no data
### Rehab
#### **All patients are prescribed excercise** -> reduces exacerbations
#### All patient groups but group A qualify for pulmonary rehab

---
## Complications
### [[COPD exacerbation]]
### Increased resistance due to reduced O2 induced vasoconstriction -> [[Pulmonary hypertension]] -> [[Right heart failure]] (Cor pulmonale)
#### Remove fluid with [[Furosemide]] and always consider take home O2 in this case
#### DO NOT use ACEi, CCB or alpha blockers in this case
### Chronic obstruction -> dilatation of bronchioles -> [[Bronchiectasis]]

---
## Aetiology
### Emphysema (loss of septa and constituent elastin)
### Chronic bronchitis (inflammation and submucosal gland hypertrophy)
## Pathophysiology
### Destruction of architecture normally maintaining small airway patency 
####  Emphysema secondary to debris deposition in alveoli -> acute inflammation and MMP release from PMNs OR lack of anti-protease -> elastin loss -> no elastic recoil of respiratory bronchioles -> indiviudal compensates using accessory muscles to 'push' the air out
##### bronchioles without elastin become compromised during forced exahalation -> increased resistance with more destruction -> prolonged straining expiration
##### Rtp801 upregulation by [[Cigarette smoke]] -> mTOR activation -> breakdown fo endothelial cells -> reciprocal apoptosis of alveoli septa and following pneumocytes -> CO2 retention without hypoxaemia/cyanosis
#### Bronchitis -> large airway inflammation and gland hyperplasia of airways -> mucous plugging and reduced airflow from fibrotic stenosis -> reduced O2 entry -> hypoxaemia -> reduced O2 in lungs causes vessel vasconstriction -> pulmonary hypertension and secondary right heart failure -> oedema
##### excess mucous -> goes down -> mucous plugging -> non-aeration of alveoli -> alveoli
