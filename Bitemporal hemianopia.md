# Bitemporal hemianopia, oftentimes first towards a red object
## DDx: Optic chiasm lesion
### Inferior temporal bias -> posto-inferior compression -> [[Craniopharyngioma]] or AcoA [[Berry aneurysm]]
### Superior temporal bias -> anteroinferior compression -> [[Pituitary macroadenoma]]
### Rapid onset -> [[Pituitary apoplexy]]

---
Mechanism: Destructive lesion oftentimes due to compression of the optic chiasm from above by an expanding suprasellar mass (craniopharyngioma) or below from a sellar mass (pituitary macroadenoma)
- Lower temporal fields cross posterior and superior  in the chiasm -> compressed first by ventricular floor mass lesions
- Upper temporal fields cross anterior and inferior in the chiasm -> compressed first by sellar mass lesions
- Lower and upper maculotemporal fields cross centrally -> last to go in chiasmatic compression

 Testing for a bitemporal field defect involves the standard routine except that the use of a red pin is particularly helpful
 - early stage compression -> defect to red pin only in upper or lower quadrants -> depending on direction of compression

[[Craniopharyngioma]]'s compress from postero-superior side of chiasm

Sellar lesions compress from the antero-inferior side of the chiasm

## Cases
A 36-year-old woman had been investigated for infertility and subsequently became pregnant following the use of clomiphene. During the pregnancy she became toxaemic, with a blood pressure as high as 200/120. In the 34th week she developed rapidly progressive visual failure thought to be due to the hypertension. On neurological examination both optic discs were pale but there was no suspicion of papil- loedema or haemorrhage into the maculae. Although visual acuity was less than 6160, using hand movements and finger counting it was obvious that there was dense bitemporal hemianopia indicating chiasmaI compression. The child was delivered by caesarean section immediately and the chiasm explored the next day. The remnants of a pituitary tumour were found admixed with blood clots. Following decompres- sion her vision became normal and the premature infant developed normally. Any delay in recognition of the clinical situation could have resulted in permanent blindness. This patient was seen in 1973, before scanning was available
