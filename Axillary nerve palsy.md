# inability to abduct ipsilateral shoulder, an obvious prominent greater tuberosity, loss of sensation in the regimental patch area 
## (indirectly) part of:
### [[Erb's palsy]]
## Includes:
### [[Regiment's patch]], [[deltoid atrophy]] and associated [[prominent greater tuberosity]]
## Notable causes:
### [[Shoulder dislocation]]
### fracture of the surgical NOH

Mechanism: traumatic force causing a destructive lesion to anywhere along the course of the axillary nerve causing clinical features in order of severity from: paresthesia -> sensory loss -> motor weakness -> motor loss
- course: terminal end of #posterior_cord -> ___ of the #anterior_axilla -> through the #quadrangular_space -> medial then posterior aspect of the #surgical_neck_of_humerus
Seen in: #peripheral_nerve #Trauma

Axillary nerve palsies are most commonly caused by a shoulder dislocation or surgical-neck of humerus fracture of the humerus -> lesioning the axillary nerve as it travels around the surgical neck of the humerus
