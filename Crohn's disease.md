#### Eyes -> [[Red eye]], [[Dry eyes]], [[Photophobia]]
##### Due to [[Anterior uveitis|Anterior uveitis]]	
#### Skin -> Rashes esp. [[Erythema nodosum]] and [[Pyoderma gangrenosum]]
#### Joints -> [[Joint pain|Arthritis]] with [[Arthralgia]]
##### Proximal joint asymmetrical oligoarticularlarge joint arthritis commonly occurs with acute GI presentation

## DDx:
### 
## Mimics:
### Infectious enterocolitis
## Workup:
### Crohn's is a histopathological diagnosis
### Start with IBD workup
#### Nutritional panel -> identify deficiencies
##### [[Vitamin b12 deficiency]], [[Folate deficiency]], [[Vitamin D deficiency]]
#### ESR and CRP elevation -> systemic response
##### LFT looking for PSC
##### PT and APTT just in case of bleeding disorder
##### FBC and Iron if bleeding
#### Stool microscopy, cultures and PCR
### Imaging
#### AXR if systemic involvement to check for megacolon
#### CT if suspicious of bowel obstruction, abscess or fistula 
#### OR
#### CT-E if stronlgy suspicious of IBD
### Some form of endoscopy when stable
#### Typically colonoscopy next day
### Often requires additional weight loss workup

# Tx
### Stool sample -> testing
#### It will not be abnormal for someone to have both infetious enterocolitis and IBD at the same time

# Malnutrition Mx
## When restarting feeding -> be careful of [[Refeeding syndrome]]
# Before starting Immunosuppressants
## Vaccination and serology
## Administer live vaccines before starting tx
# Induction immunosuppression
## Corticosteroids are first line
### If mild -> PO 50mg Prednisolone mane until response then taper across 6-8 weeks
Can use [[Budesonide]] but is not PBS :(
### If severe -> continue IV 100mg hydrocortisone QID or methylprednisone daily for 3-7 days
## If no response to corticosteroids short course -> switch to immunomodulator as a bridge before considering biologics
### PO Azathioprine or PO (or subcut or IM) MTX + folate
## If no response by 3 months -> switch to biologics
### Infliximab/adalimumab or new boi vedolizumab

# Maintainence immunosuppression

## Complications
