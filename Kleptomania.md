# A [[Impulse control disorders]]
## Clinical features:
### Upon seeing a stressor (in this case a specific object) they feel a compulsion to [[Stealing|steal it]] -> they have to do it
#### These objects are commonly of little to no value -> they could easily buy it
#### Theft of the object **reduces the anxiety and makes them feel 'right'**
### Immediately after stealing they feel guilt or remorse which is lessened by:
#### Gifting the object to someone else
#### Hoarding the object away at home
#### Returning the object back to the person!
##### Which interestingly dosen't increase the anxiety
