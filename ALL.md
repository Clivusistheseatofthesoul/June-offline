# The most common cancer in children 
## Clinical features:
### Classically a pancytopaenic prodrome with subsequent rapid accumulation of blasts everywhere in a 2-5 y/o
#### Fatigue in a child and [[Pallor]]
#### Recurrent infections and [[Fever]]
#### [[Petechiae]], [[Purpura]]
### Rapid accumulation of WBC blasts
#### Bone marrow invasion -> [[Bone pain]], Pancytopaenia
#### [[Generalised lymphadenopathy]]
#### Mets -> Testicular mets, CNS mets and [[Leptomeningeal disease]], [[Hepatosplenomegaly]]
## DDx:
### In-utero genetic mutation
### Post-conception genetic mutation
### Chromosomal abnormality
### RARELY -> [[Radiation exposure to mother]]
## Mimics:
### Meningococcal sepsis
### Vasculitis -> IgA vasculitis
### ITP
### Purpura isolated only in the face -> [[Non-accidental injury]]
## Workup:
### Bedside
### Imaging
### Labs
#### FBC + film
##### Pancytopaenic picture with blasts on film of peripheral blood
### Interventional
#### Confirm diagnosis with pathological sample from bone marrow biopsy
#### LP to check for CNS mets (~10%)
