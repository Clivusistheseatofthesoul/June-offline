# Episodes of failure to complete respiratory cycle → abscence of breathing sounds and chest movement → typically ended by a particularly loud snore
## Part of:
### [[Goitre]]

## DDx
### [[Obstructive sleep apnoea]]

---
Mechanism: transient complete closure of the upper airway during sleep due to reduced palatal muscle tone in a structurally restricted and narrow upper airway -> apnoea -> raising hypercapnia acts on -> chemosensory neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus ->  medullary respiratory group nuclei -> #pneumotaxic_centre of #parabachial_nucleus + locus coerulus 
- -> ascending CGRP excitatory neurons induce cortical arousal through the basal forebrain #substantia_inominata #CE_nucleus_amygdala and #Lateral_hypothalamic_nuclei to restore upper airway patency
- while descending FOX2p excitatory neurons drive the increasing respiratory effort 

Seen in: #ENT, #lungs
