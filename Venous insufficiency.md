# Tx
Treat venous dermatitis with a simple emollient (eg a paraffin-containing ointment), applied at least daily. Continue even after the ulcer is healed. A moderately potent topical corticosteroid in an ointment base (eg betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment) should be applied liberally to all areas of dermatitis at each dressing change until the skin is completely clear. Emollients can be applied on top of the corticosteroid. For milder presentations, a weaker topical corticosteroid such as triamcinolone acetonide 0.02% ointment could be usedâ€”hydrocortisone 1% ointment is inadequate. Topical corticosteroids can be applied safely over cracked or broken skin, and should be applied up to (and including) the edge of an ulcer.
