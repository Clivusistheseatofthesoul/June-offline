# Unawareness of own body parts
## Part of: [[Somatic illusions]]
## Description:
### Sometimes this is episodic dissappearance, fulminant deficit can produce continuous dissappearance
### If an entire half body has dissappearaed -> [[Hemisomatognosia]]
### If cognitive reserve intact, they retain insight
### In confusional states, they may proclaim that the limb is missing, look for them under the bed, or accuse others of taking them away

## DDx:
### Episodic, rapid onset which is spreading -> [[Parietal lobe seizure]]]
### Parietal sub-dural haematoma's

Mechanism: Typically destructive lesion to diffuse lesions over the #non-dominant #parietal_lobe
