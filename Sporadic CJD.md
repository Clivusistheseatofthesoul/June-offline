# Sporadic mutation in PRNP account for 80% of cases of CJD
## Clinical features:
### Age of onset typically in middle age but can occur in adolescents and early adults
#### May have a mild, neuropsychiatric or neurological prodrome which is not as overt as the one in variant CJD
##### Neuraesthenic/depressive prodrome -> progressively worsening [[Reduced appetite]], [[Persistent chronic fatigue]], [[Headache]] with strange "funny feeling in the head," sleep disturbances including [[Insomnia]] -> [[Anxiety]], [[Depressive mood]] or [[Hypomania]]
##### Dementing prodrome -> progressively worsening behavioral or cognitive changes including [[Labile affect]]
##### Focal neurological prodrome -> visual loss, cerebellar ataxia, aphasia, or motor deficits
### Progression of fulminant dementia over months -> becoming [[Akinetic mutism|akinetic and mute]] -> median time to death 4 months
#### [[Generalised myoclonus]] esp. with [[Exaggerated startle]] occassionally with [[Startle myoclonus]]
### There are subtle differences in presentation between the CJDs

## DDx:
### Spontaneous production of mutant PRNP protein
### Iatrogenic transmission 
## Mimics:
### variant CJD
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Serum genetic panel to ensure not actually fCJD
### Interventional
#### Elevated CSF-tau or [[Elevated 14-3-3 protein]]
#### If still unsure -> PCR with RT-QUIC

# Tx

## Prognosis
### 90% of patients die within 1 year

---
## Complications
### Iatrogenic transmission 

---
## Aetiology
### Paroxysmal somatic misense  mutation in codon 129 of the **PRNP** gene predisposes to misfolding
### Some age-related event may either trigger or protect from faulty folding
## Pathophysiology

#### Cases
