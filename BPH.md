Aliases: Benign prostatic hypertrophy
---
# 
## Clinical features:
### Elderly man with [[LUTS]] 
#### Esp. Difficulty starting the void -> [[Straining to void]], [[Urinary hesitancy]], [[Urinary intermittency]]
### Rubbery smooth prostate on DRE -> mobile nodule
## DDx:
###
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Clinical diagnosis without biopsy
---
# Medical Tx is first line
## Dilate the urethra -> immediate symptomatic benefit
### [[Alpha1 blockade|Tamsulosin]] to increase dilation of urethra and surrounding prostate
## Shrink the prostate -> chronic reduction of size and prophylactic treatment
### Reduce growth of glands by [[5alpha reductase inhibitor]]
## Can combine medications if severe
### MTOPS trial
# Refractory Sx should be managed with surgical resection
##

---
## Complications
### [[UTI]]
### Obstruction gets to point of [[Urinary retention]]


---
## Aetiology
### Originates in the transitional zone -> benign hyperplasia -> never turn malignant (risk no higher than default population)
#### Time -> 5alpha reductase expression by prostatic stroma -> increased exposure of PSA secreting glands to DHT -> more growth over time 
## Pathophysiology
### Hyperplasia causes failure of detrusor to contract correctly
### Compress floppy urethral tube -> canno't dilate during micturition
#### Strain to get it out, hard to get out due to reduced calibre, tube will collapse when insufficient pressure generated
