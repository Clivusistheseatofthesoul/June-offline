Aliases: Neglect syndrome

# Disorder of hemispheric visuospatial processing resulting in a neglect syndrome to the visuospatial field contralateral to the pathology
## Classification:
### One of the following in the sensory-motor continuum:
#### Unimodal sensory inattention -> Visual extinction, Auditory extinction, tactile extinction 
#### Multimodal sensory inattention -> Egocentric neglect
#### Representational inattention -> Allocentric neglect
#### Motor inattention -> or Hemiakinesia 
### One of the following in the personal-spatial continuum:
#### Within body inattention -> Personal neglect
#### Within grasp-space inattention -> Peripersonal neglect
#### Within distant/navigational inattention -> Extrapersonal neglect

Multimodal S + body inattention -> dressing apraxia
Multimodal S + peripersonal neglect -> constructional apraxia

Mechanism: Destructive lesion to the attentional network: most commonly found to pathology affecting the #non-dominant hemisphere esp:
- #Inferior_parietal_lobule 
- #temporoparietal_occipital_junction
- #dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex 
- #mesencephalic_reticular_formation -> hemispheric hypoarousal -> secondary inattention
	- Also damage to the WM tract mediating reciprocal uncrossed connections between the #superior_colliculus <-> #dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex
