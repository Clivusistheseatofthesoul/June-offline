Early on -> reduced facial emotional expression does not mean they are not experiencing emotions
- they just canno't express it -> but given the right situation at least during early PD -> you can bring it out
	- Mr Simon an elderly fair skinned old man presenting for a routine dermatological check for skin cancer had a background history of PD which he didn't really need to tell you for you to notice. his left arm had a sort of pulsing tremor in the fingers that even when he layed them on the examination bed to support him sitting at the end of the bed you could still see the fingers tensing and releasing. Despite his expressionless face at baseline, he was an exceptionally funny man, he spontaneously told jokes, laughed at your jokes and could follow on your jokes with witty reply that was concordant with the initial joke. He **can** smile, and when he did you could tell that the original part of himself re-emerged for a brief few seconds. He was a polite man, apologising profusely for taking too long to undress for the skin check. He was concerned as well, worrying about the surgery he already organised with the surgeon without consult Dr Pereria. With some assurance from her, he quietly put his fedora on, and smiled before leaving the consult room
