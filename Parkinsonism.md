# Syndrome characterised by prescence of bradykinesia with some of the following: Rigidity, Resting tremor, postural instability
## Includes:
### Requires [[Akinesia|Bradykinesia]] -> [[Akinesia]]
### Requires one of the following:
#### [[Lead-pipe rigidity]]
#### Typically unilateral [[Parkinsonian tremor|Pill-rolling tremor]] -> when combined with the hypertonia becomes -> [[Cog-wheel rigidity]]
##### Bring it out through hand movements on the contralateral side 
#### Sometimes [[Postural instability]] is included here
### Oftentimes this produces a particular gait pattern -> [[Parkinsonian gait]]

## Mimics:
### Tardive dyskinesia
### Drug use in past history of chlorpromazine or other phenothiazines -> drug induced tardive dyskinesia 

## DDx:
### [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]]
### [[Atypical parkinsonian diseases]]
### Secondary to genetic disease -> [[Wilson's disease]], [[Neuroferritinopathy]]
### [[Drug-induced Parkinsonism]] [[Anti-psychotics]]
#### Acute drug induced parkinsons
#### Subacute neuroleptic malignant syndrome
#### Chronic tardive dyskinesia

**Mechanism:** Degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons fo the #substantia_nigra_pars_compacta  result in inability of the direct pathway to correctly focus and filter movement programmes over the indirect pathways + acetycholinergic pathway
