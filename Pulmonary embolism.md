## Clinical features:
### Non-specific symptoms -> textbook description often not seen in real life
### Dead lung -> [[Haemoptysis]]
### Ischaemia of pleura -> [[Pleuritic chest pain]]
### V/Q mismatch -> [[Hypoxaemia]] -> compensatory [[Sinus tachycardia]] and [[Tachypnoea]]
### On ausculation -> oftentimes a clear chest
#### Classically a [[Pleural rub]]
### Look for features of a [[DVT]] in the legs
## DDx:
### Secondary to [[DVT]]
## Mimics:
### Pneumonia and pneumothorax often mimic it
## Workup:
### Calculate the Well's criteria
#### If Well's score < 2 -> likely not PE -> r/o test with d-dimer
#### If Well's score > 4 -> likely PE -> CT-PA or V/Q scan
##### Need normal kidneys in order to get the CTPA, if not -> just go to VQ scan
##### If no CT emergently available -> administer prophylactic anticoagulation -> start [[DOAC]]

# Tx
## If pleuritic chest pain -> Analgesia
## If SpO2 < 90% -> O2
## PE with hypotension -> IV tPA 
## Otherwise [[Anti-coagulation]] to stabalise clot
### Heparin or LMWH bridge to warfarin
### [[DOAC]]

---
## Complications
### [[Hypoxaemic respiratory failure]] -> compensatory [[Sinus tachycardia]] and [[Tachypnoea]] -> [[Respiratory alkalosis]]
### Complications of anticoagulation -> ICH
### Massive PE using up all the factors -> chronic compensation of coagulant factors results in even more clotting -> '*clotting begets clotting*' -> [[Chronic DIC]]
