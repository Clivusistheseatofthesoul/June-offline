Mechanism: Anything that causes excess circulating corticosteroids

Cushing's syndrome can be exogenous (overwhelmingly common) and endogenous (relatively rare)

- Screened for
- Exogenous → Iatrogenic effects of steroids

- Endogenous → workup required to differentiate between

    Need to do an ACTH level and dexamethasone suppresion test (high dose)

    - Primary hypercortisolism → Adrenal tumor/hyperplasia

        ACTH undetectable

    - Secondary hypercortisolism → ACTH-omas

        ACTH normal or elevated; dexamethasone suppression with large dose suppresses pituitary only

        - pituitary adenoma
        - Ectopic
            - bronchial adenomas and carcinomas
            - pancreatic cancers
