# Volume depletion/Patient is dry/ lost fluids
## Clinical features:
### History features ^7549fa
#### Insensible water losses -> Fever and [[Hyperhydrosis]], [[Tachypnoea]]
#### MedHx of [[diuretics]]
### [[Oliguria]], [[Polydipsia]], [[Rapid loss in weight]]
### [[Orthostatic hypotension]] [[Orthostatic tachycardia]] -> [[Syncope]]
### [[Reduced skin turgor]], [[Dry mucous membranes]] -> only really useful in peads
## DDx: 
#### [[Acute diarrhoea]], [[Dehydration]], [[diuretics]] + [[Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia state|HHS]] + [[Diabetes insipidus]], 
#### Haemorrhage -> Apparent, or hidden
## Mimics:
###


## Workup:
### Clinically assessed but there are investigations which point towards dry state
### Labs
#### Serum BUN
##### Elevated serum BUN due to renal hypoperfusion
Specifically you are looking for an:

		Elevated serum [BUN]/serum [Cr]
## Complications:
### Hypotension -> [[Shock]] 
### Electrolyte disturbances -> [[Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia]]

Fluid depletion (hypovolaemia) occurs as a result of loss of total body sodium.


- the clinical features of fluid depletion align with progression of loss of ECF fluid:
    - <5% ECF loss
        - polydipsia
        - oliguria
        - reduced skin turgor
        - dry mucous membranes
    - 5-10% ECF loss
        - worsening skin turgor
        - orthostatic hypotension
        - orthostatic tachycardia
    - 10% ECF loss or more
        - hypotension → shock
            - Cold and clammy
            - poor capillary refill
        - tachycardia
        - stupor → coma
