# Lack of conscious awareness of the contralateral visual field and body map. Typically demonstrated on replication of clock faces, line-bisection task, Ota's search task to differentiate between allocentric and egocentric neglect
## Description:
### Neglect is a failure to acknowledge a contralesional stimulus— regardless of the presence or absence of a competing stimulus in ipsilesional space
## Part of:
### [[Anton-Babinski syndrome]], [[Neglect]]
## DDx:
### Acute course 
#### Cortical sign -> [[Non-dominant MCA infarct]]
#### Subcortical sign -> thalamic, putamen infarct/haemorrhage
#### Both -> [[Watershed infarct]]
### Insidious course -> [[CNS mass lesion]] [[Acute Sub-dural haemorrhage]]

Mechanism: 
- Destruction of the conscious egocentric spatial map of the body and the world + disconnection of corticofugal fibres underneath the #non-dominant #supramarginal_gyrus of the #Inferior_parietal_lobule 
	- vascular supply by: #ICA → #MCA (M1) → MCA-M2/3 (anterior or middle trunk) -> MCA-M4 as #angular_artery 
- Destruction of cortico-thalamic loop: from parietal and STG region towards the ipsilateral #pulvinar_nucleus_thalamus, putamen and back -> most commonly found in the non-dominant thalamus

Seen in: #Neuro, #Ischaemia, #Haemorrhage
