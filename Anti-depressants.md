# Countra indications
# Administration
## Generally, follow the rule of 6
	1. > 6 weeks of any anti-depressant trial before stating it is efficacious or not
	2. > 6 months of treatment once you've found an efficacious regimen
	3. > 6 weeks of 'washout' to avoid toxicity syndromes (at least for the old meds)
## Efficacy
### The combination of psychotherapy AND anti-depressant medications is always more efficacious than either medications or psychotherapy alone
