# Acute change in level of consciousness and/or cognition is typically 
## Assessed by
### Decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
### Witness complaint of any strange deviation in normal behaviour or cognition
## Progression of state of consciousness along:
### Agitation <-> Somnolent -> [[Coma]]
## Includes:
### New onset [[Sundowning]], [[Altered mental status]] with cognitive and consciousness level change that is fluctuant throughout the day
## Part of
### [[Raised ICP]], [[Acute Encephalopathy]], [[SIADH]]

## DDx: 6 clinical phenotypes of AMS
### Fluctuant LOC and cognition -> [[Delirium]] -> mixed, hypoactive or hyperactive delirium
### Non-fluctuant -> [[Agitation|Non-delirious agitation]], [[Excessive daytime sleepiness|Non-delirious somnolence]], [[Catatonia]]


---
**Mechanism:**  damage to the reticular formation (structure in the brainstem that 'initiates' consciousness) most commonly -> cholinergic deficiency and dopaminergic excess
- ↑ ICP → brain herniation 
- Metabolic disturbance 
- TBI -> Acute torque on midline brainstem structures

# Approach
## Assessment of severity
### Consider calling for more help and transfer to high-dependancy unit if:
#### A -> Unarousable and/or not protecting airway
#### B -> Hypoxaemic which is not manageable by current unit or hypercapnia requiring BiPAP
#### B -> Suspicion of new methaemoglobinaemia
#### C -> Haemodynamically unstable or considering cardiogenic shock
#### D -> New focal neurologic signs
### Recheck vitals -> glucose
### Obtain 'history' from -> nursing staff and patient signout in the notes -> MedHx, Labs review
#### There may be previously used Tx which worked for previous episodes seen during the day
#### Check substance use history
#### Elderly with urinary complications -> [[UTI]] [[Pyelonephritis]], [[Urinary retention]]
### Fast exam: Cardiovascular + gastro + [[FAST Neuro screen]]
#### Prescence of any FND -> CNS aetiology -> **CT head stat** -> LP if CT negative -> EEG if LP negative 
#### Negative Neuro screen -> likely [[Acute Encephalopathy]]
### Metabolic panel, ABG or VBG, urine dipstick and tox screen
### Consider bladder US in elderly at risk of urinary retention

## DDx: HE STOPS 4 TIPS on VOWELS (AEIOU)
#### H -> [[Hypertensive crisis]] -> [[Hypertensive encephalopathy]], [[Hepatic encephalopathy]]
#### E -> Electrolyte disturbances -> Na+ and Ca2+ specifically 
#### S -> Massive bilateral stroke, PCA stroke or aphasic symptoms
#### T -> Toilet and Head trauma including haemorrhages -> Either [[Urinary retention]] and [[Bowel obstruction]]
#### O -> [[Opiods]], [[Anti-cholinergics]]
#### P -> [[Psychosis]], [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]
#### S -> Abscence seizures, [[Cognitive seizure]] and [[Serotonin Syndrome]]
#### 4 -> (4x inflammatory conditions)
#### T -> Pyrexia 
#### I -> Infection -> [[UTI]], [[Pyelonephritis]], [[Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis|SBP]], [[Encephalitis]]
#### P -> [[Porphyria]]
#### S -> [[Sepsis]]
#### A -> [[Acidotic encephalopathy]]
#### E -> Endocrine -> [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]], [[Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia state|HHS]], [[Hypos]], [[Thyroid storm]], or severe [[Hypothyroidism]] causing [[Myxoedema coma]], [[Adrenal crisis|Addisonian crisis]]
#### I -> Intoxication and withdrawral -> [[Benzos]], [[Alcohol intoxication]], [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome]] -> Also [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]], [[Osmotic demyelination syndrome|Central pontine myelinolysis]]
#### O -> O2 and CO2 -> [[Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy]], [[Hypercapnic encephalopathy]], [[Methaemoglobinaemia]]
#### U -> [[Ureamic encephalopathy]]

# Workup
## Before you do anything
### People with altered mental status (esp hyperactive) are often scared, frightened and very confused
## Initial workup
### Bedside -> vitals spo2, bsl, bladder scan, UA, medication review!!!! 
### Imaging -> CXR, AXR
- CT-brain if warranted (head injury, focal neuro signs)
- EEG only if very difficult to seperate from a seizure E.g absence vs hypoactive delirium
### Labs -> bloods fbc euc kidney function lft crp
### Procedures
- LP if fever, headache (weird temporal lobe and/or psychiatric signs)

# Mimics: Wernicke's aphasia, Kluver-Bucy syndrome

# Tx
## When do I sedate?
### To allow for essential investigations and/or treatment
### Patient is at danger of harming themselves or others
### Agitation and hallucinations are causing distress to themselves such that **they canno't get Mx**
## Sedation agent choice
### Typically [[Haloperidol]]
#### PO, IM or IV 0.5mg up to Q2hrs -> max of 4mg in 24hrs
#### Less sedation and anticholinergic side effects but may worsen confusion, extrapyramidal side-effects and impair swallowing
### If neurological disease/Parkinson's -> [[Quetiapine]] instead to minimise extrapyramidal side effects
### If not swallowing -> [[Olanzapine]]
#### Wafer 2.5mg up to 5-10mg in 24hrs
## Should I ever use benzos?
### NO! Unless:
#### [[Delirium tremens]] from [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome]]
#### OR from [[Benzo withdrawal]]
## If [[Delirium]]
### Treat the medical cause first
### Start the non-pharmacological interventions
--- 
Rapid onset of a floridly abnormal mental state with:
- Disturbed consciousness, disorientation, severe motor restlessness, fear, irritability, consistent misperception of sensory stimuli and visual hallucinations
There may be lucid periods with hyperactivity during which the patient is agitated, talkative and irritable. There may be hypoactive periods with hypersomnolence and sleep–wake inversion
