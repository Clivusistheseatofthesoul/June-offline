## Clinical features:
### [[Fever]] with classically a [[wet cough]] (and if with clear consolidation on CXR) -> that is automatically pneumonia
#### Supportive features are -> [[Chills, rigors]]
#### Atypical pneumonias can present with [[Dry cough]] and predominance of non-specific systemic findings
### Auscultation findings consistent with lung consolidation
#### Reduced air entry if massive consolidation
#### Bronchial breath sounds in a particular region ± coarse crackles -> which do not clear with coughing
#### Dull to percussion in the same area
#### Classically a [[Pleural rub]]
## DDx:
### Setting of pneumonia determines the likely culprit organisms and treatment
#### [[Community acquired pneumonia]]
#### The lobar pattern pneumonias are caused by classic bacterial pneumonia
#### Bronchopneumonia or patchy pattern penumonias are caused by [[Walking pneumonia]], [[Interstitial pneumonia]]
#### Children -> [[CAP in peads]]
#### Hospital acquired pneumonia ([[HAP]])
#### Ventilator associated pneumonia ([[VAP]])
### Vulnerable patient cohorts determines treatment also
#### [[Pneumonia in the immunocompromised]]
#### Pneumonia in those with chronic suppurative lung disease
### The causative mechanism of the pneumonia determines long term prevention
#### [[Aspiration]]
## Mimics:
### Pulmonary abscess -> caused by anaerobic organisms

# Workup:
## Triage and initial assessment for severe pneumonia is assessed by red-flag system 
### Prescence of any of the following warrants admission
#### [[Tachypnoea]] esp. resting tachypnoea > 22
#### [[Sinus tachycardia]] > 100 bpm
#### [[Hypotension]] with systolic BP < 90
#### Confusion or any altered mental status
#### SpO2 < 92%; or lower than tolerated baseline for those with lung disease
## Initial rapid POC testing for outbreak pathogens
### Flu swab should be obtained in flu season + COVID-19 swab should be obtained (2019-202x)
### Urinalysis -> Pneumoccocal and legionella antigens only if
#### severe pneumonia
#### suspected legionella outbreak
## Routine Ix for all those with suspected pneumonia
### CXR
#### Find interstitial or patchy infiltration rather than classical lobar infiltrate
### FBC, BMP and VGB ± blood culture
#### Leukocytosis
#### serum lactate > 2 mM is a red flag for severe pneumonia
#### Low haematocrit and high BUN are negative prognostic markers
## Admitted patients
### All admitting patients should get an ECG
#### Pneumonia triggered arrythmias + cardiac aetiologies which can mimic a pneumonia
### Consider ABG; always do ABG if severe pneumonia
#### Hypoxaemia and acidaemia are negative prognostic markers
### Calculate SMART-COP score to determine definitively if severe pneumonia
#### Severe pneumonia = Anticipated need for ventilation and ICU support
#### Not severe pneumonia = moderate severity pneumonia = admit onto ward
### Cultures like sputum, blood culture only neccessary if
#### severe pneumonia OR you have prophylactically covered broad spec
#### [[Pneumonia in the immunocompromised|They are immunocompromised]]
#### History of MRSA or pseudomonnas infection 
#### Recieved IV abx in the last 90 days

### Aim to get blood cultures before starting IV abx

# Tx
## Admission
### If sick as shit -> automatically escalate to vanc + piptazo and then de-escalate after sputum culture from BAL
### Monitering
#### DO NOT track recovery progress with CXR -> the CXR will worsen when theyre getting better
#### Only CT image if it regresses
### Get them out as soon as you can
#### Early ambulation -> only limitation should be hypoxaemia so give them O2 to get them moving anyway
#### If possible -> advance diet early -> don't keep people NPO if you dont have to

---
## Complications
### Hepatisation -> [[Hypoxaemic respiratory failure]]

## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
