## Clinical features:
### [[Raised ICP headache]] with focal cortical signs -> often mimicing dementia
#### Often in parietal lobe producing -> [[Gerstmann's Syndrome]], [[Apraxias]] and [[(Egocentric) visuospatial hemineglect syndrome]]
### Those with [[Alcohol use disorder]] and those who are [[Elderly]] are more likely to have 'brittle' veins due to bone encasement 
### Even minor injury or acceleration of the head can rupture veins 
## DDx:
### [[TBI]] => esp. from acceleration deceleration injuries I.e whiplash injuries
## Mimics:
### Dementias
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis

# Tx
## Decompressive craniotomy

## Complications

---
## Aetiology
### Shrunken brain results in bridging veins being stretched out from the dura -> more easily ruptured with minor shear
1.  Nomenclature for exonic variants: where X is Wild-type amino acid and Y is allele amino acid
	`Inherited/somatic + (inheritance pattern) + silent/misense/nonsense allele leading to -> Xxx-codon number-Yyy on _GENE_ locus (99p/q99) -> leading to LOF/GOF mutation causing + (describe effect and precipitants) `
