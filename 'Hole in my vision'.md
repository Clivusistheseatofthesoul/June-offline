# Presenting complaint of (oftentimes acute onset) hole in their vision E.g not being able to see parts of the clock -> classic of a central field scotoma 
## Includes:
### [[Caecocentral scotoma]]

Mechanism:
Seen in: #eyes

When this is present, confrontation testing should still be done but don't expect to find a peripheral field defect -> much better to let the patient move a white pin around and find where it dissappears -> move it around to size the scotoma 
- Pay particular attention to whether:
	1. **The defect crosses the horizontal meridian**: Retinal lesions due to a vascular occlusion cannot do so
	2. **The defect extends to the blind spot**: Defects due to B12 deficiency, toxins or glaucoma usually extend into it. This is called a caecocentral scotoma
	3. **The defect crosses the vertical meridian**: Organic visual field defects due to pathway damage have a sharp vertical edge at the midline.
