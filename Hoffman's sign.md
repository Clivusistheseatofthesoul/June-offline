# When stabalising the hand and finger at the PIP, flicking the distal phalanx down at the nail results in reflexic flexion of surrounding fingers 
## Description
### [[Hyper-reflexia]] of the FDP
### Best seen when the middle finger is flicked and the pointing finger is watched for flexion
### Can be a normal variant -> only useful if unilateral
## DDx: An [[UMN signs|UMN sign]]

---
Mechanism: Loss of UMN inhibition of stretch myotactic reflex to the flexor digitorum profundus results in flexion of the surrounding fingers when one is flexed. This can be a normal variant as well. (So check both sides)
Seen in: CNS, Ischaemia, Neoplasm, Trauma, haemorrhage #Neuro #Ischaemia #Neoplasm #Trauma #Haemorrhage

Hoffman's sign is an **UMN sign** for the upper limb.

- It is suggestive of hyper-reflexia with the myotactic stretch reflex which results in contraction of surrounding fingers powered by flexor digitorum profundus
