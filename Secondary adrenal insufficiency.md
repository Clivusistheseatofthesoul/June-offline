# [[Adrenal insufficiency]] -> Reduced secretion of adrenal cortex hormones due to reduced activity in HPA axis by reduced ACTH
## DDx: Iatrogenic axis suppression 
### Sudden discontinuation of Chronic [[Corticosteroids]]
### Physiologic stressor during Chronic [[Corticosteroids]]
### Reduced ACTH production due to Sellar mass lesion is much more rarer -> [[Pituitary macroadenoma]] or [[Craniopharyngioma]] causing Panhypopituitarism
### Genetic syndrome causing reduced ACTH production E.g [[POMC deficiency]]
