# Set of localising signs suggesting myelopathy to the central canal region of the spinal cord
## Includes:
### [[Cape distribution sensory loss]] of pain and temperature, [[Brachial diplegia]]
### If Cervical in localisation -> also presents as ipsilateral [[Horner's Syndrome]] with upper quadrant anhydrosis
## Clinical features:
### Two possible presentations
#### Slow erosion presents as progressive [[Cape distribution sensory loss]] of pain and temperature eventually leading to mild [[Brachial diplegia]]
#### SCI hyperextension (esp. in the elderly) results in sudden [[Cape distribution sensory loss]] and severe [[Brachial diplegia]]
## DDx:
### [[Syringomyelia]]
### [[Spinal cord injury]] -> specifically the [[SCI_hyper-extension]] injury -> suddden onset secondary [[Syringomyelia]]

Mechanism: Expansion of the central canal or damage to surrounding white matter results in localised and segment specific damage to bilateral decussating spinothalamic fibres in the #anterior_white_commissure â†’ segment restricted distribution of pinprick and temperature sensation loss
