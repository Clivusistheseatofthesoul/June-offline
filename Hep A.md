# Summary
-   Escherichia coli is a normal component of the gut flora
    -   Initially, overwhelming expansion can cause diarrhoea with O157:H7 EHEC causing severe, haemorrhaagic and watery diarrhoea + Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
    -   when given the opportunity for expansion it can invade into surrounding mucosal and epidermal surfaces causing → UTI, Ascending cholangitis → eventually to distant organs which are **life-threatening** → Neonatal meningitis
    -   HepA is a RNA virus
		-   Does not intergrate into the genome of the host cell -> easier to eliminate and treat
