Aliases: Lateral thalamic syndrome
---
# 
## Clinical features:
### Isolated [[Hemisensory loss]] or [['Dense' Hemisensory loss]] -> oftentimes with [[Umbilical anaesthesia]], [[Intraoral anaesthesia]]
#### Thalamic sensory loss tends to involve all modalities, including vibration, which is never lost with a lesion of the cortex
#### Typically DC-ML affected moreso than AL tract
#####  Some thalamic lesions may blunt cold but not heat sensation
####  The sensory loss may be bilateral around the umbilicus and intraorally
### Some will have acute onset [[Hemisensory dysasthesia]] 
#### Most develop it post-stroke 
### If haemorrhagic conversion -> compression of surrounding IC -> subtle pyramidal signs 

## DDx:
### 
## Mimics:
### FHx, evidence of altered sensory processing -> Migraine with somatosensory aura
### Subcortical infarct causing pure sensory syndrome is very rare
## Workup:
### non con CT head of suspected ischaemic stroke
