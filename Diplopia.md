# Double vision
## Approach:
### 1.		Monocular vs binocular
#### [[Monocular diplopia]]
### 2. 		Onset:
#### Acute -> 
#### Gradual -> More likely to be mechanical
### 3.		Character
#### Mechanical -> painful, feels like there's something behind the eye
#### Brainstem lesion -> Objects split vertically (i.e [[Vertical diplopia]])
### 3. 		Timecourse:
#### Constant -> [[Abducens palsy]], [[Oculomotor palsy]]
#### Comes and goes -> latent strabismis, [[Myaesthenia gravis]], [[Trochlear palsy]]
##### Worst in the morning -> [[Graves' orbitopathy]]
##### Gets progressively worse throughout the day, better with sleep or a nap -> [[Myasthenia gravis]]
### 4. 		Associated: Pain
#### Painful [[Oculomotor palsy]] esp. in diabetic [[Mononeuritis multiplex]]
### 5. 		Associated: Ipsilateral ptosis 
#### Oedema -> Allergic swelling of eyelid
#### Complete -> [[Oculomotor palsy]] 
## On Exam:
### Forced closure of eyelids
#### If normal reflexes, nil sensation changes -> suspect NMJ disease
### Special tests: 
#### Cover testing:
#####  This test is based on the fact that the separation of the two images becomes greatest as the eyes attempt to look in the direction of action of the weak muscle, because the disparity in eye movements is then maximal. The false image falls progressively further away from the macula of the lagging eye and is there- fore always projected as the outer image of the two. If the examiner asks the patient to follow a stick until double vision is maximal, and then determines which eye he must cover to obliterate the outer image, the affected eye is identified. The weak muscle can then be determined from the direction of the gaze

## DDx list:
### Monocular diplopia
### Binocular diplopia
#### Restrictive/mechanical orbitopathy
##### [[Graves' orbitopathy]] and [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
#### NMJ disease
##### [[Myaesthenia gravis]]
#### Neurological cause
##### EOM CN palsies
##### Infectious and inflammatory syndromes -> Brainstem [[Meningitis]], [[Miller-Fisher Syndrome]]
##### Toxic encephalopathy -> [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]]


Mechanism: Any lesion in the pathways controlling eyemovements from the extraocular muscles to the MLF and cerebellum â†’ cortical lesions will not present as diplopia
