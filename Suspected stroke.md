# Presentation with suden onset weakness or sensory disturbance immediately trigger's the stroke workup
## ABC + bGL + O2 sat 
### Massive strokes, mass lesions, brainstem strokes other mimics that cause [[Altered mental status]] and reduced level of consciousness -> canno't protect airway -> intubate
### Hypoventilation or reduced O2 sat -> Supp O2 to ≥ 94%
## Rapid but accurrate History
### Onset of stroke symptoms + precipitants
#### Hyperacute onset is suggestive of vascular event 
#### Onset of symptoms <4.5 hours ago -> qualifies for IV tPA
##### If info unavailable -> assume to be TLSW (E.g time they went to bed night before)
### Associated features
#### Features of activating lesions before destructive sign onset -> see bright lines, hearing noises, pins and needles, twitching and involuntary movements
### Targeted PMHx to r/o differentials
#### Known migraine with aura + FHx -> [[Hemiplegic migraine]]
#### T1DM on insulin
#### History of uncontrolled hypertension
common cns Migraine, seizure, trauma and bleed
common systemic hypoglycaemia, drug toxicity
rarer -> infections
### PMHx to determine eglibility for tPA
#### Stroke, hit your head, or had surgery done on the brain or spine in the last 3 months?
#### Have you ever had a brain bleed or bleeding into the skull?
#### Are you currently bleeding anywhere? 
##### Have you recently coughed up/vomited up blood?
##### Have you noticed colour changes in your stool or urine?
#### Do you have any other medical or surgical disease that may has been treated already?
#### Are you currently on any medication (look and ask for recent warfarin and heparin?)
##### This is a relative contraindication
## Obtain NIHSS score (BP + bGL + O2 sat if not done already)
### Screen's for stroke + predictor of stroke severity, short-term and long-term prognosis
## Everybody gets: emergent non-conCT unless outside tPA window
### if there is no haemorrhage and no features suggestive of other disease, with visible thrombus -> CT-A, CT-P as well
#### If the ischaemic core > 1/3 size of its cerebral lobe -> it is too late
### If IV clot busting not possible -> MRI, MR-A, MR-P for potential mechanical thrombectomy
# Acute therapy focuses on early repurfusion
## Administer [[tPA]] to clot bust with door-needle time < 60mins
### If they satisfy the [[tPA|indications]] and have none of the absolute contraindications:
 ![[tPA#Countra indications]]
### tPA can be administered at the same time as performing mechanical thrombectomy
## Additional mechanical thrombectomy if large clot 
### NIHSS must be > 5 and mRS < 3
### There is sufficiently large penumbra on CT-P
### proximal segment large artery occlusion
## If neither can be done and no haemorrhage -> Aspirin 325mg and supportive care only
### Do not give loading dose aspirin only if:
1. Patient has a bleeding disorder or is taking an anticoagulant (needs immediate admission for imaging to exclude a haemorrhage)
2. Patient is already taking low-dose aspirin regularly: continue the current dose of aspirin until reviewed by a specialist
3. Aspirin is contraindicated: discuss management urgently with the specialist team
## If either tPA or mechanical thrombectomy done -> start aspirin 24hrs after repurfusion tx imaging shows no haemorrhagic transformation
### ![[TIA#For high-risk TIAs and minor ischaemic strokes - first 3 weeks should be dual anti-platelet aspirin clopidogrel]]

# Acute supportive care
## Airway -> intubate those that canno't protect airway
## Breathing -> Provide O2 if hypoxaemic
## Circulation -> maintain permissable hypertension to keep perfusing ischaemic penumbra
### If aiming for/current on tPA treatment -> <185/110 (need to meet both)
### If not egligible for tPA -> <220/120 unless [[Hypertensive crisis]] or [[Pre-eclampsia]] present
### Lower with IV [[vascular specific CCBs]] or [[larbetalol]]
### If already on anti-hypertensives Restart outpatient anti-hypertensive's to lower back down 24hrs after symptom onset
# After thrombolysis/thrombectomy
## Hourly -> obs, severe headache, reduced GCS
### If deterioration -> scan urgently for suspected [[Intraparenchymal haemorrhage]]
# Once stable -> initiate search for aetiology
## Full MRI, MR-A, DWI-MRI if able to -> confirm anatomic territory
## Telemetry while inpatient -> 2 week portable ECG after discharge
## Echocardiogram + Carotid US
### Typically TTE ± bubble if young stroke patient 
## If no aetiology -> consider cryptogenic causes
### All should get fasting lipid panel to reveal hidden lipohyalinosis
### Consider vasculitic screen in those at risk
### Consider coag workup if at risk 
# Initiate rehabilitation -> early initiating maximises recovery
## ST swallow assessment prior to oral meds or diet
## PT, OT and ST should all be started as soon as the patient is awake and stable to participate
# Initiate secondary prevention of further strokes
## If non-cardioembolic aetiology -> Anti-platelet med for thrombus prophylaxis
### Consult neuro for -> 
## If cardioembolic in aetiology -> [[Anticoags]]
### Start Warfarin or DOAC depending on severity of stroke
## If significant ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis -> expedited carotid endarterectomy (< 2 weeks)
# Minimise risk factors
## EVERYBODY GETS: Atorvastatin 80mg 
### independent of baseline LDL!
## Long-term Hypertension Tx
## Elevated HbA1C -> initiate T2DM Mx
## Lifestyle modification -> Smoking cessation, regular excercise, weight loss to healthy BMI
