**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion to LMNs in #Detrusor_nuclei (Onuf's nucleus in #S2_segment, #S3_segment, #S4_segment comprising the #conus_medullaris) travelling to the detrusor while pudendal nuclei in sacral cord are spared and become disinhibited
- Constant contraction of external sphincter despite stretch of bladder due to urine buildup results in urinary retention and ballooning of the bladder with a **normal vesiculoureteral pressure**
