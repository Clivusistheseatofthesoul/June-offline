# Combined set of signs of varying severity typically involving upper lid retraction, exposure of the upper limbus and buldging appearance of the eye due to true exopthalmos
## Includes:
### [[Exopthalmos]], [[periorbital oedema]], [[Chemosis]]
### [[Lid lag von Graefe's sign]], Bilateral [[lid retraction]]
### Needs to occur in the context of: Smooth [[Goitre]]
### If exopthalmos is severe -> [[Lagophthalmos]] -> [[Corneal abrasion]]
## DDx: [[Grave's disease]]
### Rarely -> can also be caused by [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]
## Complications:
### [[Corneal abrasion]]
### Optic nerve compression -> sight-threatening graves orbitopathy -> [[blindness]]

**Mechanism:** Antigen in the soft tissue and extraocular muscles in the orbital apex have an antigen that is cross-recognised by the Anti-TSH autoantibody → inflammatory infiltration of orbital soft tissues → fibroblast stimulation to produce hyaluronan (proteoglycan which sequesters fluid) + differentiation in adipocytes → increased intra-orbital pressure → exopthalmos
**Seen in:** #endocrinology #autoimmune

Whilst an exopthalmos alone is not pathognomonic of Grave's disease → bilateral exopthalmos **is pathognomonic of Grave's disease.** There are several complications of orbitopathy that must not be ignored:

- chemosis - oedema of conjunctiva and injection of sclera, particularly over insertion of lateral rectus
- conjunctivitis → bacterial or viral due to prolonged exposure and drying of tear film
- corneal ulceration → due to inability to close eyelids
- optic atrophy → rare and possibly due to optic disc nerve stretching
- ophthalmoplegia → from lymphocytic infiltration leading to ocular muscle weakness; inferior rectus muscle lost first → **cannot look out then down** later convergence is weakened
