# A form of [[Neurogenic bladder]] secondary to cord damage
## Includes:
### [[Urinary incontinence]] with [[Urinary retention]]
#### Differentiating factor with uninhibited bladder is the high intravesicular pressure -> [[Valsalva manoeuvre]], [[Crede manoeuvre]] to relieve
##### Elevated pressure causing 1 of 3 straining patterns:
- **Type 1 DSD -> Sudden release after straining**
	- increasing sphincter activity during detrusor contraction which then ceases and detrusor pressure decreases to allow urination
	- Incomplete spinal lesions

- **Type 2 DSD -> [[Urinary intermittency]]**
	- Sphincter spasm during voiding may prevent complete bladder emptying
	- Complete spinal lesions

- **Type 3 DSD -> Severe [[Acute urinary retention]] -> [[Chronic urinary retention]]** 
	- Continuous sphincter activity during detrusor contraction resulting in inability to void per urethra
	- complete spinal lesions
##### Frequent [[lower UTI]] and [[Vesicoureteral reflux]] -> [[Hydronephrosis]] -> [[Pyelonephritis]] + [[AKI]]
#### [[Urinary incontinence]] due to not being able to appreciate when the bladder is full before sudden [[Urge incontinence]]
##### Only signs being paroxysmal sympathetic dysreflexia -> [[Paroxysmal hypertension]], [[Palpitations]], [[Hyperhydrosis|Diaphoresis]], [[Pallor]]


## DDx:
### Posterior circulation ischaemic stroke
### [[Cord compression|Spinal cord compression]] which is above the conus medullaris
### [[Myelodysplasia]], Spinal plaques in [[Multiple sclerosis]]

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion to UMNs in #spinal_cord travelling to the detrusor or pudendal nuclei (part of Onuf's nucleus) in the sacral spinal cord (S2_segment, S3_segment, S4_segment comprising the conus_medullaris)
- Inability of the intergrated messages to be communicated to sacral nuclei -> both sphincter and detrusor contraction at the same time -> increased intra-vesicular pressure
-  If the detrusor pressure exceeds sphincter pressure incontinence occurs else urinary retention occur
