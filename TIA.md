Aliases: Transient ischaemic attack

# Mini-stroke -> stroke-like symptoms typically for <60min with **no infarction on DWI MRI**
## Clinical features:
### Common general features -> Acute onset [[Headache]], [[Dysarthria]]
### Anterior circulation -> 
### Posterior circulation -> 
## TIA syndromes:
### [[Limb shaking syndrome]] -> caused by severe Carotid artery stenosis
## Mimics:
### Seizures
### Migraine with aura
### TGA
## Workup:
### Non-con CT-brain only done if suspecting a bleed
#### Esp. important if they are on anti-coagulation -> can bleed into ischaemic zone
#### HTN
### ECG Â± basic coag panel
### Urgent MRI-brain with MRA and MRV
### Carotid dopplers

# Tx
## Initial antiplatelet
### Give aspirin 300 mg immediately provided no bleed, unless
1. Patient has a bleeding disorder or is taking an anticoagulant (needs immediate admission for imaging to exclude a haemorrhage)
2. Patient is already taking low-dose aspirin regularly: continue the current dose of aspirin until reviewed by a specialist
3. Aspirin is contraindicated: discuss management urgently with the specialist team
## Almost always -> Urgent assessment at TIA clinic < 24hrs or admission 
### Only if the TIA episode occured > 1 week ago -> TIA clinic as soon as possible within 7 days

# Secondary prevention of stroke
## Everybody gets prescribed lifestyle modification
## Everybody gets some form of anti-thrombotic pharmacotherapy
### Never prescribe both anti-coagulation and anti-platelets together 
### Long term anti-coagulation is preferred over anti-platelet tx in patients with thrombosis secondary to cardiac disease
#### If Non-valvular [[AFib]] -> [[DOAC]]
#### If valvular disease or thrombus secondary to M.I -> [[Warfarin]]
### Everyone else should get anti-platelets
#### The actual regimen is controversial
##### For high-risk TIAs (and minor ischaemic strokes) -> first 3 weeks should be dual anti-platelet [[aspirin]]+[[clopidogrel]]
This should not be continued long term unless there is another indication to do so (currently only: coronary stent or concurrent ACS)
## Those with symptomatic carotid stenosis with occlusion > 50-70% should recieve endarterectomy in within 2 weeks
### Always recommended in those with > 70% occlusion
### Only recommended in those with > 50% occlusions if significantly miniscule operative risk 
## Risk factor control
### Those with clinic [[Hypertension|BP >140/90mmHg]] should have BP medication initiated or intensified 
### All patients with possible atherosclerotic component and reasonable life span remaining get a [[Statin]] with target of LDL < 1.8

Most commonly caused by thromboembolism secondary to large artery [[Atherosclerosis]], [[Cardioembolism]] or from [[Shock]]

## Start dual antiplatelets
## If symptomatic carotid artery stenosis > 70%
### Carotid endarterectomy < 2 weeks
