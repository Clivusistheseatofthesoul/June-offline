#  illogical, sudden, and frequent changes of topic despite normal rate of speech and ideas
## Description:
### The mental leap just dosen't make sense, like a knight's move on a chessboard to someone naive to how chess works -> the moves only make sense to the patient who can play the game
### This is compared to flight of ideas which is derailment thinking with pressured rapid speech
## DDx:
### [[Schizophrenia]] and other [[Psychosis|Psychotic disorders]]
