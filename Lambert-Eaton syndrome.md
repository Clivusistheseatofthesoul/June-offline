# Clinical syndrome characteristic of autoimmune generated antibodies towards the presynaptic VGCCs
## Includes:
### [[Triple-A sign]] -> [[Ataxia]], [[Absent reflexes|Areflexia]], [[Pure autonomic failure]]
### [[Proximal muscle weakness]] which improves with repitition 
### Notably -> autonomic symptoms: [[Dry mouth]], [[Erectile dysfunction]], difficulty micturating
## DDx:
### Paraneoplastic -> [[Small cell carcinoma of the lung]]
### Primary

Mechanism: big muscles which aren't tonically contracted all the time require more depolarisation to overcome the Ab's binding to the VGCCs -> strength improves with repitition of depolarisation
