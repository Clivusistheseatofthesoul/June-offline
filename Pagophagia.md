An elderly lady with a furrowed mouth was admitted for end of life care from metastatic pancreatic cancer. She spoke little words, often with a strangulated and broken quality somewhat akin to the raspy tone you would experience the day after a saturday night binge. I assume this was likely permenant from a past basal ganglia stroke. She was of Hispanic background,  but either with her son translating in person or with a translater via phone, it was incredibly difficult to make out what she was attempting to say. The only thing we could really make out initially was '*Agua*'
> "*Agua! Agua! Agua! ...*" Was the only thing I could make out, 

The son would later explain she likes only cold chilled water, or '*Cocacola*' which he bought for her from the **chilled** vending machine.
