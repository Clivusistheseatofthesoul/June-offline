# Fibrous stricturing of entire hepatic duct tree
## Clinical features:
### [[Cholestasis]] with chronic constant [[RUQ pain]] -> [[Jaundice]] with [[Cholestatic itch]]
### PMHx
#### [[Ulcerative colitis]], [[HIV]]
### FHx
#### Another family member with PSC
## DDx:
### 80% of patients with PSC have [[Ulcerative colitis]] -> although only 4% of patients with UC will ever develop PSC
#### Much more rarely is assocaited with Crohn's disease
### Also caused by [[HIV]] -> 'HIV cholangiopathy'
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Radiological diagnosis
### Labs
#### LFTs
##### Cholestatic picture -> Cholestatic enzymes elevated with both GGT and ALP elevated
Hepatocellular enzymes may or may not be elevated depending on activity of hepatitis
#### p-ANCA is elevated in 94% of patients
### Imaging
#### MRCP -> then ERCP if non-diagnostic 
##### "Beads on a string" Segmental bile duct stricturing with saccular dilatation of normal intervening areas

---
# Tx
## Symptomatic relief of pruritis
### Cholestyramine
## ERCP to dilate and stent strictures
### If deterioration continues despite stenting -> suspect [[Cholangiocarcinoma]]

# Medical DMT Tx
## There is no DMT currently available
###
# Curative Tx
## Liver transplant 

---
## Complications
### Recurrent episodes of acute bacterial [[Ascending cholangitis]]
### Bile backflow -> chronic hepatitis -> [[Chronic liver disease]]
### [[Cholangiocarcinoma]] in 10%!
### Increased risk for [[Colorectal cancer|CRC]]

---
## Aetiology

## Pathophysiology
### Both intra and extrahepatic hepatic ducts become chronically inflammed, fibrosed -> strictured
#### Backpressure of bile -> [[Chronic hepatitis]] -> cirrhosis -> [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|HCC]]
