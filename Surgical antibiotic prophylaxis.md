# Most post-operative infections are caused by organisms which have already colonised the patient 
> In most cases, avoid using broad spectrum antibiotics for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis

# For most cases
> Use ([[Cefazolin]] or [[Gentamycin]]) Â± [[Vancomycin]] or [[Teicoplanin]])

If Cefazolin is contraindicated
- Gentamycin is the second line or used as first line if broader cover is required

## Vancomycin or Teicoplanin added only for ![[Vancomycin#Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in]]

# Days before the surgery
## Decolonise paitents at risk of MRSA infections 
### Screen for S. aureus carriage from multiple cutaneous sites
### If S. aureus status is known -> just proceed with decolonisation without swab
## Start decolonisation before surgery (don't have to finish entire process before surgery starts)
>   [[Mupirocin]] 2% nasal ointment inside each nostril BD for 5 days with one of the following:
		>   - Shower with wash containing Chlorhexidine 2% daily for 5 days
		>   - Bath containing 60 mL of [[Sodium hypochlorite]] solution daily for 5 days
		>   - Chlorhexidine-impregnated washcloths, applied the night before and morning of surgery
# Surgery day
## How many doses? 
> Typically only a single dose is required UNLESS:
1. There is a significant delay in operation after the prophylaxis was given
2. 2+ half lives of the antibiotic have elapsed since the last dose and the surgery has not closed
3. Excessive blood loss during surgery (1.5L or more)

Here are common intraoperative redosing intervals:

| Antibiotic               | Redosing interval | Halflife for reference |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Cefazolin                | q4hrs             | 1.2-2.2hr              |
| Gentamycin               | Not required*     | 2-3hrs                 |
| Vancomycin               | q12hrs            | 4-8hrs                 |
| Teicoplanin              | Not required**    | Several days           |
| Metronidazole            | q12hrs            | 6-8hrs                 |
| **More rare abx's used** |                   |                        |
| Benzylpenicillin         | q1hrs             | 30mins                 |
| Cefoxitin                | q2hrs             | 0.7-1.1hrs             |
| Clindamycin              | q6hrs             | 2-4hrs                 |

*Gentamycin does not require redosing intraoperatively due to its 'Post-antibiotic effect' whereby bacteriocidal activity continues for many hours after plasma concentration is undetectable

*Teicoplanin does not require redosing due to its insanely long half-life
