# Laboratory defined as: serum [Na+]< 110 -> typically suggesting hypotonic fluid state
## Clinical features:
### [[Nocturnal muscle cramps]] + Altered mental status -> typically [[Delirium]] -> [[Seizures]]
## Approach:
![[HypoNa Flowchart.jpeg]]
### If acutely symptomatic with reduced GCS/coma ± seizures -> just initiate Tx with 3% NaCl
### Sometimes ↓ [Na+] ≠ hypotonicity; take urine glucose dipstick
#### **Serum osmolarity should usually means hypotonic plasma** -> serum Osm can be calculated to see the exceptions:
	serum Osm = 2x[Na+] + ([blood Glucose]/18) + (BUN/2.8)
#### If the serum osmolarity is not hypotonic -> the hyponatraemia is lying to you (sometime else is hogging up the osmolality) and one of the following are the causes:
##### If serum Osm is actually hypertonic -> something else is taking up the space
Toxic ingestion -> [[Alcohol substitute intoxication]], [[Mannitol]]
Severe hyperglycaemia -> [[Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia state]], [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]]
##### If serum Osm is actually isotonic -> lab error in [Na+]
Severe [[Hyperlipidaemia]], or [[Hyperproteinaemia]] -> no acute danger, lab error
### The ADH increase could be appropriate to some new behavioral change; Check Urine Osm ^7539fc
#### Supportive labs -> urine Osm < 100
#### [[Hyponatraemia#^70b78a|Physiologic causes of increased ADH]]
### Now that you have a ↓ [Na+] cause of hypotonic plasma, and know ADH is not pathologically elevated -> the DDx are varied but can be classified by fluid status; ascertain fluid status + take Urine [Na+]
#### [[Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia]] -> any cause of volume depletion 
#### [[Euvolaemic hyponatraemia]] -> RAT|S 
#### [[Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia]] -> any hyperdynamic circuation 

## DDx of hypotonic hyponatraemia by aetiology:
### Elevated ADH:
#### Reduced BP -> [[Hypovolaemia]]; Hyperdynamic circulations (not CKD, see later) -> [[CCF]], [[Chronic liver disease]]
#### Endocrinopathies -> [[Renal tubular acidosis]], [[Adrenal crisis|Addisonian crisis]], [[Hypothyroidism]]
#### [[SIADH]] 
#### SIADH mimics -> [[Cerebral salt wasting]],[[Reset osmostat]] 
### Appropriate ADH ^70b78a
#### End stage [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]]
#### Primary [[Polydipsia]] 
#### [[Beer protomania]] and [[Tea and toast diet]]

# Tx
## Tx: Emergency ^05f0dd

### If actively seizing or in coma -> Severe acute hypernatraemia (transcellular shift unable to compensate) -> **Start 3% Saline NOW**
### Route
#### IV!!!
### Drugs
#### This is the only instance ever you will use hypertonic 3% saline
### Max rate 
#### Same for any other case (can not be to fast) -> correct <0.25 each hr ( < 1 per 4 hrs)
### Push rate
#### Raise Na+ immediately over first 4 hrs until symptoms improve then **hold it there for the rest of the day**
![[Pasted image 20210104010034.png]]
### Followup
#### Check electrolytes and change if appropriate every 4hrs (should only change by 1)
## Tx: In any other case

^aec0c5

### Severe chronic all the way to mild hypernatraemia 
### Route
#### PO (if irreversible SIADH) or IV
### Drug
#### Normal saline, salt tablets if the SIADH is not acutely reversible
### Max rate
#### Same for any other case (can not be to fast) -> correct <0.25 each hr ( < 1 per 4 hrs; < 6 per 24 hrs)
### Push rate
![[Pasted image 20210104010415.png]]
### Followup
#### Check electrolytes and change if appropriate every 4hrs (should only change by 1)

## Complications
### Correction past max rate -> [[Osmotic demyelination syndrome]]

---
## Misc
### Duration of Tx
