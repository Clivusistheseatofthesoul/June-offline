Aliases: Type I respiratory failure

# PaO2 < 60 on ABG in room air with a normal or low PaCO2 -> due to lung parenchyma failure
## Clinical features:
###
## DDx: Due to severe V/Q mismatch
### Secondary to [[Pneumonia]]
### [[Pulmonary oedema]] causing vascular shunts
#### Cardiogenic has peripheral oedema and elevated JVP
- [[Left heart failure]], [[CCF]]
- but also -> Any [[Tachyarrhythmia]] causing LV failure
#### Non-cardiogenic causes do not have peripheral oedema and elevated JVPs ->
- [[ARDS]], Secondary to [[Pulmonary embolism|PE]] and [[TRALI]]
- [[Opiod toxicity]], [[Salicylate toxicity]]
- High-altitude exposure -> [[HAPO]]
###  Massive something in lung taking up space -> causing dead-space not ventilated 
#### [[Haemothorax]], [[Pneumothorax]], [[Chylothorax]], [[Pulmonary embolism]]
### Obstructive lung disease with maintained respiratory drive
#### Pink puffers [[COPD]], [[Asthma]]
### Restrictive lung diseases
#### [[Interstitial lung disease|ILD]], [[Thoracic kyphosis]]
