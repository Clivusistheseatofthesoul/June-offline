# Inability to carry out, on command, learned **meaningful skilled** simple motor acts despite adequate motor and sensory abilities
## Descriptor:
### When asked to pantomime a transitive act with a tool or repeat a meaningful motor behavior they will perform specific errors:
#### Classically [[Tool substitution]] or [[Loss of meaningful gestures]]
#### Movement errors or exaggerrated and inappropriated joint involvement with transitive acts
##### When asked to pantomime using a screwdriver -> will rotate and abd/adduct shoulder along with elbow
#### Tool orientation errors
##### Holding the comb the wrong way around
#### Spatial and temporal errors
##### Brushing teeth with a toothbrush held vertically throughout
### Knowledge of object and task is still present
### Typically only dominant hemisphere lesions -> producing bilateral deficits
#### Can appear as ipsilateral deficit due to contralateral hemiparesis from large lesion
## Part of:
### [[Apraxias]]
## DDx:
### Secondary to ischaemic stroke
### Neurodegeneration
#### Classically said to be the hallmark of [[Corticobasal syndrome]]
#### [[Alzhiemer disease]], [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]] and [[PSP]]

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion to nodes, or disconnection between hubs of the [[frontoparietal ideomotor praxis network]] -> which is lateralised to the [[dominant lobe]]
- Destructive lesion to the #dominant #Inferior_parietal_lobule  movement representations encoding the spatial and temporal patterns of skilled movements are stored within the left IPL
	- Vascularised by: Dominant #MCA -> #angular_artery 
- Destructive lesion to the #dominant #lateral_PMA resulting in impaired motor sequencing of the motor concept plan

**Seen in:** #Neuro

Patients with IMA must know what they are told to do. Thus, patients with Wernicke's aphasia, agnosia, and asymbolia must be excluded as confounds in any diagnosis.
