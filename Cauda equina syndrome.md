# Cauda equina syndrome
## Includes:
### Presentation is often more gradual and asymmetrical
### Bilateral leg pain + [[Flaccid paraplegia]]
### [[Saddle anesthesia]]
### Bladder and bowel -> [[Urinary retention]] presents late in disease course
### Pudendal -> [[Erectile dysfunction]]
### Bowel -> faecal incontinence
### Legs -> bilateral [[ankle reflex (absent)]] + absent [[Babinsksi's sign]] I.e no plantar reflex at all
### Key feature is **absent** lower limb reflexes I.e **arreflexia**
### Compared to other cord compressions:
| Feature            | Cauda equina syndrome                                | [[Conus medullaris syndrome]]                                                                | Other [[Cord compression]]                                        |

| Px                 | Gradual subacute Neurologic deficit                  | Sudden loss of bowel/bladder                                                                 | Variable                                                          |
| Weakness           | Painful weakness in lower limbs                      | ± weakness lower limbs, oftentimes no radicular pain                                         | Bilateral spastic paraparesis with Nil. pain unless pinched nerve |
| Sensory            | [[Saddle anesthesia]] ± [[Radicular pain]] into legs | Peri-anal anesthesia                                                                         | Variable                                                          |
| Bladder bowel      | LMN type -> Urinary retention late in course         | LMN type -> Urinary retention -> overflow incontinence + faecal incontinence early in course | UMN type -> Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia                        |
| Reflexes           | Ankles always absent ± knees absent                  | Ankles may be variable/hyper-reflexic ± upgoing plantars depending on location               | Nil change                                                        |
| Sexual dysfunction | Loss of reflexogenic, preserved psychogenic erection | Loss of reflexogenic, preserved psychogenic erection                                         | Preserved reflexogenic, loss of psychogenic erection              |
| Common causes      | L2 or below vertebral fracture                       | L1-L2 fracture, neoplasia, tethering of cord                                                 | Neoplastic, Fracture > L1                                         |
## DDx:
### Acute L2/3 midline disc prolapse
### Vertebral fracture below L2 
### Secondary to to lumbar canal stenosis 
## Mimics:
### Conus medullaris syndrome
### ACA infarction -> would initially produce a flaccid leg but always has hyper-reflexia!
### Para-sagittal CNS tumor
