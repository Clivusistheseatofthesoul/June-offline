# Inability to carry out dextrous learned motor action
## Descriptor:
### When asked to 
#### Fruitless attempts usually precede wrong movements, which in turn are frequently contaminated by extraneous movements
#### Some will get fustrated and some patients use the less affected or normal hand to reproduce the posture requested
### Knowledge of ask is still present
### Left sided lesions produce contralateral deficits
## Part of:
### [[Apraxias]]
## DDx:
### Secondary to ischaemic stroke
### Neurodegeneration
#### Classically found as a [[clumsy hand]] in [[Corticobasal syndrome]]
#### [[Primary progressive apraxia]]
#### [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]]

**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion to the motor nodes, or disconnection of the motor nodes from other hubs of the [[frontoparietal ideomotor praxis network]] -> which is lateralised to the contralateral hemisphere
- Destructive lesion to the #contralateral  #ventral_PMA resulting in impaired grasp and dexterity of the contralateral limb only
- However, destructive lesions to the dominant hemisphere ventral-PMA can result in bilateral deftness impairment in those RHD individuals
	- In LHD individuals, deftness is always controlled by the contralateral hemisphere ventral PMA ^[https://n.neurology.org/content/55/4/523.short]

Patients with LKA must know what they are told to do. Thus, patients with Wernicke's aphasia, agnosia, and asymbolia must be excluded as confounds in any diagnosis.
