Aliases: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, CVST
---
# A form of [[Cerebrovascular disease]] involving thrombosis of a cerebral vein or venous sinus 
## Clinical features
### Typically a general syndrome of headache and raised ICP 
#### [[Isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome]] -> especially subacute progressive headaches, but sometimes they can be explosive in character -> [[Thunderclap headache]] character
##### Worsen's with valsalva/coughing and in the morning 
##### Oftentimes associated with [[Nausea and vomiting]], [[Photophobia]] and [[Phonophobia]]
#### If [[Unilateral papilloedema]] -> especially worrying for sinus thrombosis
##### Worsen's with valsalva or lying down/recumbency
### Cerebral focal neurologic signs Â± brainstem features in certain sinus thrombosis syndromes 
#### Ocular signs with headache -> [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]] and [[Cavernous sinus thrombosis]]
#### Other cranial nerve combinations -> likely Jugular or transverse sinus thrombosis
#### Isolated [[Pulsatile tinnitus]], [[Raised ICP]]  -> Jugular vein or lateral sinus thrombosis
#### Seizures -> complication of cortical cerebral vein thrombosis
### Subacute encephalopathy -> [[Altered mental status]]
##### If severe (with coma, bilateral motor deficits) -> suspect deep cerebral vein thrombosis E.g Galen, straight sinus
### PMHx:
#### [[Hypercoagulable states]] esp. [[OCP]]
#### History of [[DVT]] or [[Pulmonary embolism|PE]]
### Rarely caused by a traumatic LP
## Classification:
### Characterised by location

### Characterised by cause: 
#### Local causes can be septic or aseptic -> [[Aseptic venous sinus thrombosis]], [[Septic venous sinus thrombosis]]
#### Local aseptic causes:
##### Iatrogenic -> secondary to LP or neurosurgery
#### Local septic causes: 
##### [[Acute complicated sinusitis]], [[Pyogenic meningitis]], [[Tuberculous meningitis]], [[Mastoiditis]] -> lateral sinus thrombosis, [[Periorbital cellulitis]] -> cavernous sinus thrombosis
#### Systemic causes can be congenital or acquired [[Hypercoagulable states]]
##### Congenital -> Thrombophilias E.g Factor V leiden, Protein C/S deficiency
##### Acquired -> [[OCP]], [[Pregnancy]], [[HRT]], [[EPO]], [[Trousseau's syndrome]]
##### Also Bacteraemia and sepsis
## Mimics:
### Migraine!
### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension 
### SAH -> not too bad... you're imaging this anyway
## Workup:
### MRI-B with MRV or nonconCT-B with CT-V
---
# Tx
## Medical intervention with [[Anticoags]]
## Aetiology determination 
### Thrombophillia panel
### 
---
## Complications -> just like ischaemic stroke
### Haemorrhagic transformation -> F.N.D -> if large enough -> cone
### supratentorial lesions, cortical vein thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis and puerperal CVT -> predictors of [[Seizures]] typically generalised seizures

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### Venous occlusion -> venous congestion and backlog of pressure 
#### raised ICP
