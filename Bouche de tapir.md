# The upper lips of the patient thicken and protrude
## Description
### Because of the weakness, the lips move little, but droop tonelessly, leaving an involuntary protrusion of the upper lip, thought to resemble the mouth of the tapir with its overhanging upper lip
### When the patient with FSHMD laughs, the lower face does not move; mirth shows in the eyes but not in the mouth
## DDx:
### [[FSHMD]]
