# Involuntary grasping of the examiners finger upon stroking of the thenar eminence
## Part of:
### [[Frontal release signs]]

## DDx: Causes of destruction to the OFC
### Neurodegeneration -> [[FTD]], [[Alzhiemer disease]], [[Diffuse Lewy body disease]], [[Vascular dementia]]
### trauma? -> TBI and CTE?

Mechanism: Destructive lesion to the #Orbital_Frontal_Cortex of the #Frontal_cortex finhibitory pathways → frontal release sign of primitive reflexes → no inhibitory control of brainstem-spinal reflex → re-emergence of the grasp reflex
- vascularised by: #ICA -> #ACA -A2 -> #fronto_polar_artery and #orbito_frontal_artery

Seen in: #Neuro, #Ischaemia, #neurodegeneration
