# Conjugate gaze deviation + head turning towards the side ipsilateral of the destructive FEF lesion -> often resolves with time
## Part of:
### [[Frontal lobe seizure]]
## Includes:
### Ipsilateral head and eye deviation in destructive lesions
### Contralateral head and eye deviation in activating lesions

---
Mechanism: 
- Destructive lesion to the #frontal_eye_field -> inability to direct eyes over to coordinates within the contralateral visual field processed by the visual cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere + unabalanced activity of contralateral frontal eye field -> deviation of eye to the #ipsilateral visual field
	- Vascularised by #ICA -> #MCA 
- Destructive lesion to the anterior limb of the internal capsule
	- Vascularised by striate perforators from ACA incld. #artery_of_Percheron and MCA
- Destructive lesion to the **contralateral** #Parapontine_reticular_formation
	- Lateral pontine lesion 

Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia

Main clinical sign is the conjugate gaze deviation (most commonly to ipsilateral side) with head version towards the affected side, additional features include:
- Hypometric contralateral voluntary saccades 
- Difficulty initiating contralateral voluntary saccades
- Bilateral impaired smooth pursuit is noted bilaterally but with greater severity  for targets moving toward the side of the lesion
- There may be impaired ability to inhibit inappropriate saccades to a novel visual stimulus as well
- Lesions of the SEF cause impairment of the ability to make a remembered sequence of saccades to visible targets, while dorsolateral prefrontal lesions cause impaired performance to antisaccade tasks

Whilst the conjugate gaze deviation and head version tend to resolve with time -> **typically within a few hours** (proportional to the severity of the lesion), impaired initiation and hypometria of voluntary saccades ± prescence of nystagmus often remain despite compensation and rehab
