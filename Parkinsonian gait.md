# 'Locked-in' hesitant gait pattern 
## Description:
### Upon standing they have a narrow base with locked in limbs and [[Camptocormia]]
### Early on, they may just have slightly reduced stride length and potentially increased number of steps to turn 
#### Walking will also tend to distract and bring out the [[Parkinsonian tremor|Pill-rolling tremor]]
#### [[Stress gait]] will also bring out the tremor 
### As the disease progresses -> they have increased [[Postural instability]]
### In severe cases -> intiation of walking is exceptionally difficult -> [[Freezing of gait]] -> and once they do initiate gait they have a [[Festinating gait]]
#### Freezing is exacerbated by corridors, doorways and certain visual obstacles 

## Part of:
### [[Parkinsonism]]

Mechanism: Due to effect of parkinsonism on gait
Seen in: CNS, Neurodegeneration
Sign: Gait with unilateral reduced arm swing, generally slow shuffling gait with narrow base and prescence of turning 'en bloc or freezing upon entering tight corridors

Multiple clinical aspects of parkinson disease contributes towards the characteristic changes in gait seen in parkinsonian gait.

- the slowness of gait results both from the prescence of bradykinesia and from worsening balance
- Postural changes due to rigidity result in a stooped kyphosed posture, with shoulders flexed, lower limbs brought it
    - This results in the narrow base
    - Narrow base + postural changes shifting centre of gravity forwards results in → series of small rapid steps which catch up to their own centre of gravity upon intitiation of movement to accomodate for the balance changes → **aka festination or festinating gait**
- Reduced stride length and reduced arm swing ipsilateral to the side of the dominant tremor (which can be brought out by stress gait) are also features -> may become a full [[Magnetic gait]]
- Trouble selecting and filtering correct movement results from inability to select correct motor programmes in basal ganglia direct pathways by indirect pathway and acetylcholine competition
    - Turning aroud is achieved in small steps which change the body angle a small amount each time → **turning 'en bloc**
    - **Freezing** of behavior during encounter of new stimuli in proximity to body due to inability to select correct movement to maneuver across the newly detected visual obstacle. Will see repeated attempts to reinitiate gait that fail

The **freezing** of gait episodes **have an intermittent character and worsen when turning and while approaching a narrow passage (crossing a doorway)**. The second and third fragments show the beneficial effect of visual and auditory cueing. The fourth fragment shows the patient during the on-phase, showing a clear therapeutic effect of dopaminergic medication."
