# Constellation of symptoms and signs suggestive of fluid in the interstitium of the lungs
## Includes:
### [[Acute Dyspnoea]], [[Orthopnea]], [[Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea]], [[Wet cough with pink frothy sputum]], [[bibasal coarse crackles]]
## Part of:
### [[Hypervolaemia]]
## Workup:
### Perform resp, cardiac and fluid status exam
### If still unsure -> bedside US looking for dilated IVC and LV function 
## DDx: Cardiogenic vs non-cardiogenic causes
### Cardiogenic has peripheral oedema and elevated JVP
#### [[Left heart failure]], [[CCF]]
#### but also -> Any [[Tachyarrhythmia]] causing LV failure
### Non-cardiogenic causes do not have peripheral oedema and elevated JVPs ->
#### [[ARDS]]
#### Secondary to [[Pulmonary embolism|PE]] and [[TRALI]]
#### [[Opiod toxicity]], [[Salicylate toxicity]]
#### High-altitude exposure -> [[HAPO]]

Mechanism: 
- LHS heart failure resulting in elevated pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure causing **transudate** to leak through
OR
- Inflammation in the lung parenchyma resulting in capillaries to go permeable causing the squeezing out of **exudate**

Unlike in pleural effusion, Hypoalbuminaemia alone is insufficient to cause pulmonary oedema
- Although hypoalbuminemia can lead to peripheral edema by lowering the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient, it does not generally produce pulmonary edema. The pulmonary capillaries appear to have a greater baseline permeability to albumin and therefore have a higher interstitial oncotic pressure (about 18 mmHg) than do peripheral capillaries. A fall in the plasma albumin concentration is associated with a parallel decline in the pulmonary interstitial oncotic pressure. The net effect is little or no change in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient and therefore no pulmonary edema, unless there is a concurrent rise in left atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures
