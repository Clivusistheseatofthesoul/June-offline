---
Mechanism: Destructive lesions anywhere to the "centro-medial core" of brain frontal-subcortical circuitry â†’ disruption of generating goal driven behavior mediated by the meso-limbo-cortical dopamine pathways: #ventral_striatum or #dorsal_striatum -> #anterior_thalamic_nucleus -> bilateral frontal periventricular white matter -> #anterior_cingulate_cortex
- vascularised by #ICA -> #ACA and #MCA -M1 -> specifically the anatomical variant #artery_of_Percheron 
- as this is the more severe version of abulia -> often seen in #bilateral ACA infarcts

Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia #mass_lesion
