# Tx

## Patient education (esp. if HIV or smoking)
Prevention of hairy leukoplakia starts by having a healthy immune system. Patients should be educated to follow the prescribed HIV treatment plan and dental hygiene routine. Also, steps should be taken to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As people with HIV who have the habit of smoking are also at a greater risk of getting it in comparison to those who do not smoke, the patient should be educated in this regard.
