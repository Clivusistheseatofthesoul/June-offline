# Chronically reduced CO due to organ failure of the heart 
## Clinical
### Sx of [[Hypervolaemia]]
## Classification
### LHS vs RHS failure determines which clinical features of heart failure you see
#### [[Left heart failure]]
#### [[Right heart failure]]
#### [[CCF]]
### Systolic failure (HFrEF) and Diastolic failure (HFpEF) helps sort the aetiologies
#### Systolic failure is a broken pump -> can't push blood forward anymore
##### When it balloon's out -> Dilated cardiomyopathies (concentric hypertrophy)
##### When it's dead (70%) -> Multiple [[Myocardial infarction]]
##### When it leaks -> Regurgitive Valvular diseease
#### [[HFpEF|Diastolic heart failure]] is a swollen pump -> reduced volume available -> pumps small amounts
##### Extramural restriction -> [[Acute cardiac tamponade]], Constrictive pericarditis
##### Muscular hypertrophy ->  [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies]] and [[Restrictive cardiomyopathy]] (eccentric hypertrophy)
##### Infiltrative disease -> [[Amyloidosis]]

## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis

---
# Tx
## Referral to heart failure programe/clinic
## Reduce preload and afterload by reduction in fluid volume -> lifestyle fluid restriction
### Reduced salt diet, fluid restriction, reduce alcohol

---
# Medication therapy are added in layers -> start with neurohormonal blockade and add on from there

## All patients get Neurohormonal blockade

### [[ACEi]] or [[ARBs]] or [[ARNI]] (+ eplerenone if you have K+ to spare) 
## Afterload reduction
### [[Beta blocker]] -> carvedilol, metropolol and bisoprolol
## Diuresis 
### K+ sparing (aldosterone antagonists) diuretics first for the additional neurohormonal benefit
#### Aldosterone antagonists require regular monitoring and EUCs
### Addon Thiazide + loop diuretic later if still hypervolaemic

---
## Complications
### [[Acute heart failure|Acute decompensated heart failure]]
### Reduced CO -> increased sympathetic outflow to compensate reduced MAP 
#### RAAS activation -> sodium retention and fluid overload -> [[Hypervolaemia]] -> increased preload -> [[Hypertension]]
#### Beta1 receptor activation -> increased chronotropy and ionotropy -> chronically causes myocardial damage and arrythmogenic
#### Alpha receptor activation -> increased PVR -> increased afterload -> [[Hypertension]]
