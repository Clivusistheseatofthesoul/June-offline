# Prescence of a corrective saccade to re-foveate onto the nose
## DDx:
### Unilateral corrective saccade -> reduced firing of vestibular organ the head movement is pointing towards
### Bilateral corrective saccades without hearing loss -> [[Gentamicin]] toxicity

Mechanism: corrective saccade indicates a deficient VOR on the same side of the head turn, indicating a peripheral vestibular lesion on the same side
- catchup saccade driven by FEF supranuclear pathway which is much slower
