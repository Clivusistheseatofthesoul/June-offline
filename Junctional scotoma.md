Aliases: Junctional scotoma of Tranquair, Anterior chiasmal syndrome
---
# Peculiar bilateral eye field defect with  ipsilateral central scotoma and an inwards encroaching contralateral [[Superior quadrantopia|superior]] temporal quadrantanopia 
## DDx: Compression at the optic nerve-chiasm junction
### Olfactory groove, tuberculum sella and sphenoidal ridge [[Meningiomas]]

---
Mechanism: Bundles within compression at the junction between the optic nerve-chiasm in order are:
1. Central papilloemacular bundle crossing at the chiasm -> central scotoma ipsilateral to the lesion
2. Forward sweeping superior temporal fields after crossing from the contralateral optic nerve (Von Willebrand's knee) -> Superior temporal quadrantanopia of the contralateral eye which encroaches from the periphery to the fovea
