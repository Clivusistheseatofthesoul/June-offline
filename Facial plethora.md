Chronic 'blushing' is found often in cases of people with Cushing's syndrome → very wide range of aetiological possibilities causing the plethora itself

- Instead of changes in blood flow this is caused by protein breakdown and atrophy of the epidermis and underlying collagen matrix → thinning of the skin → increased translucency revealing the capillary beds

More seemingly idiopathic 'blushing' which has no immediate syndromic cause has a wide variety of differentials:

- Fever, Menopause, and Rosacea are the most common causes:
