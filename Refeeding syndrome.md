# 
## Clinical features:
###
## DDx:
### Eletrolyte derrangement (esp. in Mg2+ and Phosphate) due to restitution of caloric intake after 
#### [[Starvation]] or chronic fasting 
##### [[Anorexia nervosa]]
#### [[Crohn's disease]]
#### Post-[[Bariatric surgery]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Deranged electrolytes
##### Classically [[Hypophosphataemia]]
But can also be Low K, Low Mg

---
# Tx
## Ensure thiamine proficient
###

---
## Complications
### [[Acute coronary syndrome]]
### Respiratory failure
### Dropped thiamine -> [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]]

---
## Aetiology
### Rapid insulin release due to access to food -> forcing electrolytes to flood into starved cells
### Biological imperative to produce protein -> ADP -> ATP conversion induces [[Hypophosphataemia]]
## Pathophysiology
### ATP in metabolic pathways and 2,3 DPG in erythrocytes resulting in tissue hypoxia and impairment of myocardial contractility
