Aliases: Lateral medullary syndrome, PICA syndrome

# Set of signs which accompany infarction of the lateral medulla due to occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery
## Includes:
### [[Central Vertigo]] + ipsilateral [[Sensorineural deafness]]
### [[Ipsilateral face + Contralateral body distribution]] Hemisensory loss
### **Differentiating factor with [[AICA syndrome]] -> [[Dysarthria]], [[Dysphagia]] ± contralateral [[Uvula deviation]]**
### Others: [[Intractable hiccups]]

## Complications:
### Haemorrhagic transformation -> infratentorial haemorrhage, specifically -> [[Cerebellar haemorrhage]]

Mechanism: ischaemic stroke to PICA → ischaemia of the #lateral_medulla
- Vascularised by: #PICA 
	- Vestibular complex + cochear nuclei -> Vertigo + ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss
	- Inf.CP -> Ipsilateral (mixed?) ataxia w/ falls to ipsilateral side -> gait ataxia +  ipsilateral limb ataxia ± central nystagmus (rotatory, torsional, multidirectional, rebound etc) 
	- Mes. nucleus CnV + Spinothalamic tract (already crossed) -> ipsilateral face contralateral body pain temp loss
	- Nucleus ambiguus -> palatal weakness -> **dysarthria, dysphagia, contralateral uvula deviation **
	- descending sympathetic UMNs -> ipsilateral Horner's syndrome 
	- Respiratory centre in medullary reticular formation -> intractable hiccups
