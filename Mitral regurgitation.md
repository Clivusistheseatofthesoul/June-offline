## Clinical features:
### On auscultation:
#### [[Uniform murmur|Pan]]-[[Systolic murmur|systolic]] uniform intensity murmur

##### Often described to be of lower intensity and pitch than the strong -> VSD (which is much faster velocity)
##### Murmur intensity can be accentuated by clenching the fists to raise afterload -> pushing the blood back
#### [[Quiet S1]] and [[Split S2]]
## DDx:
### Secondary to [[Myocardial infarction]] involving the papillary muscles or chronic [[AFib]]
#### Dilatation of the LV -> dilitation of annulus -> 'Functional MR'
### [[Infective endocarditis]] and [[Rheumatic heart disease]] is rarer but possible

## Complications
### L atrial stretch -> [[AFib]]
### Functional MR begets functional MR
#### Functional MR -> LV overload -> worsening LV function -> vicious cycle
## Prognosis
### MR is the most common **clinically significant valvular heart disease**
