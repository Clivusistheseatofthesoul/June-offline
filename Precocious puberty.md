Sign: Onset of puberty before 7 in females and 8 in males: tanner stages happen earlier than normal in completely normal sequence

There are two categories for precocious puberty:

1. Gonadotrophin dependent

    This is much more common

    - Central precocious puberty → high FSH/LH inducing the high oestrogen/testosterone
    - MRI of the sella is mandatory
        - **Boys much more likely to have a tumor**
        - Girls much more likely to have an idiopathic reason → recently pinned aetiology → CNDy neuron pathology
2. Gonadotrophin independent

    This is much more rare

    - Peripheral precocious puberty
        - Gonad tumor
        - Gonad overactivity kinda like thyrotoxicosis

NB: Precocious puberty in girls can be caused by absent biological fathers with prescence of unrelated male in the household!

- possibly due to pheromones
