Mechanism: Any derangement in the structure of the uterus (such as leiomyoma, polyps, adenomyosis, malignancy or hyperplasia), derangements to the clotting pathways (coagulopathies or iatrogenically), or disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (through ovulatory/endocrine disorders or iatrogenically) can affect menstruation and lead to abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be a pathology which mimics uterine bleeding e.g cervical pathology and vaginal pathology

    - Duration of bleeding/spotting
    - Regularity
    - Flow volume
    - Intermenstrual bleeding

The causes of AUB are classified by age and then by the [PALM-COEIN ddx of AUB](../../Pathophysiology%20index%20ece86e8b0c044eada17e958a6ec5984e/Pathophysiology%20index%20by%20type%20ad8b6274d9c54c9a90bf17eb311f049f/PALM-COEIN%20ddx%20of%20AUB%20619030b90d504592a8849ce4a9f0b18f.md):

    - Immediate exclusion of ectopic pregnancy is of highest priority
    - Confirmation of Intrauterine pregnancy via transvaginal US r/o ectopic pregnancy:
        - Sub-chorionic haemorrhage (benign)
        - 1st trimester spontaneous abortion
        - Miscarriage

    Although 60% of the time is caused by atrophic vaginal epithelium or endometrium, bleeding is due to **malignancy** until prooven otherwise
