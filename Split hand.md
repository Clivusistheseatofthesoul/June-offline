# Wasting of the lateral hand on both medial and lateral surfaces
## Description:
### Wasting of the thenar eminence AND first dorsal interosseus with relative sparing of the ipsilateral hypothenar eminence and remaining dorsal interossei
## DDx:
### If in isolation -> strong suspicion of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]
### If with other signs or not both sided wasting -> [[Ulnar nerve palsy|Ulnar neuropathy]] or [[Distal median nerve palsy]] -> [[Carpal tunnel syndrome]]

**Mechanism:** C8 segment appears preferentially affected in MND → UMNs towards the LMN pools for abductor pollicis brevis far outnumber that of abductor digiti minimi → increased excitotoxicity + increased oxidative stress due to more frequent use of the thenar eminence
**Seen in:** #Neuro #neurodegeneration

If a lesion to branches of the ulnar nerve are excluded → the lesion is near certainly to the anterior horn cells of the cervical cord C8-T1
