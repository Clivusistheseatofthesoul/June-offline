# GSK-3β inhibitor
## Includes:
## Indications:
### Most efficacious [[Mood stabaliser]]
#### Most efficacious for episodic remitting [[Bipolar I]] and less for [[Bipolar II]] esp. if with psychotic features
##### Efficacious for both acute tx and prophylaxis of mania
##### Efficacious mainly for prophylaxis of depression -> not good for acute depressive episode
### Can also be used as augmentation with an anti-depressant in treatment resistant [[Major depressive disorder]]
## Acute transient side effects:
### The 3Ts will subside within a few days
#### Tiredness, an [[Lithium tremor|Essential tremor]], [[Polydipsia|Thirst]]
## Chronic side effects:
### [[Acute Li toxicity|Toxicity]] and [[Chronic Li toxicity]]
### [[Teratogen]]
#### First trimester exposure causes -> [[Ebstein's anomaly]]
#### Exposure after that causes -> [[Polyhydramnios]], Congenital [[Diabetes insipidus]], [[Floppy baby]]
### Nephrotoxic -> renal failure, but also nephrogenic [[Diabetes insipidus]]
### [[Weight gain]]
# Countra indications
## Significant renal impairment 
## Any form of cardiovascular disease
### reversible T wave changes and can unmask Brugada syndrome
# Administration 
If used as monotherapy -> takes 5-10 days to bring mania under control -> hence typically combined with anti-psychotic
# Monitering 
## Follow up schedule to ensure minimal side effects and the serum therapeautic range is 0.6-0.8mM
### Check adherence
### Lithium cognition battery
####
### ECG
#### Can cause [[QT prolongation]] and other arrhythmias potentially
### Li levels + EUC + TFT 
#### serum [Ca2+]
#### serum [CK]
### FBC + lipids + weight
#### LIthium can increase weight

# ADME
1. **PO formula only** -> Absorption through gut
2. Distribution -> **high volume of distribution** -> mainly in plasma
	- Steady state lag in the brain by 24hrs
3. Metabolism -> not metabolised
	- High plasma conc -> hypothyroidism
4. Excretion -> renal excretion only
	- 80% reabsorbed through PCT, DCT and collecting duct through NaK ATPase
	- 2x affinity for ENaC

# Mechanism
![[Pasted image 20210323133842.png]]
## Mainly through clamping GSK-3β activity
### Reduces the bad things and restores circadian clock gene expression + neuroplasticity
