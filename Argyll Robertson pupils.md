# Appearance of small, irregular, fixed pupil at rest with Light-near dissociation on testing: bilateral failure of pupils to constrict to light but perfectly normal accomodation reflex
## Part of: 
### [[Mydriasis]]
## DDx: Unilateral Argyll-Robertson 
### Waxing and waning tempo -> [[Multiple sclerosis]]
### [[Tertiary syphillis]] -> [[Tabes dorsalis]]
### diabetes mellitus,  Wernicke encephalopathy, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, herpes zoster, tumor, and hemorrhage
## Bilateral Argyll-Robertson's??? -> on closer inspection is...
### [[Senile Myosis]] or Constricting eye-drops 
### But can also be tabes dorsalis

Mechanism: Destructive lesion to #bilateral #pretectal_nucleus classically caused by tertiary syphillis -> inability to relay light information towards the E-W nucleus but preservation of ability for nearby MR subnucleus of oculomotor nucleus to activated E-W nucleus -> sparing of accomodation bilateral pupillary constriction 
Seen in: #Neuro #infection #autoimmune

The A-R pupil at rest is/are small at rest and irregular in shape
-  Often described to be oval, egg-shaped, tear shaped, irregularly polygonal, serrated, or eccentric

The Argyll Robertson pupil cannot be dilated by atropine.
- Common diagnostic mistake in the elderly is to attribute bilaterally irregular  **semidilated** pupils with light-near dissociation to Argyll-Robertson pupils -> this is [[Senile Myosis]] or due to constricting pupil drops (Pilocarpine) E.g se of pilocarpine or B-blocker drops in the treatment of glaucoma
