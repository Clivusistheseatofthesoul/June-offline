# 'Grasp dysmetria' → unable to reach out and grasp things correctly (by impaired finger-nose) despite normal motor, somatosensory, visual field function, and abscence of cerebellar findings
## Part of:
## [[Balint syndrome]]

---
Mechanism:
Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia

Original case as described by Bálint:

- ‘while cutting a slice of meat...which he held with a fork in his left hand, ...would search for it outside the plate with the knife in his right hand’, 
- ‘...while lighting a cigarette he often lit the middle and not the end’ ... ‘Thus, when asked to grasp a presented object with his right hand, he would miss it regularly, and would find it only when his hand knocked against it.
