# Ipsilatral eye inwards
## Part of:
### [[Orbital apex syndrome]], [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]], [[Diplopia]]
## DDx: 
### Causes of [[Raised ICP]]
#### esp. Posterior fossa [[Intracranial neoplasm]] in children
### Focal lesion at the petrous tip
#### [[Gradenigo syndrome]]
#### Lateral sinus thrombosis in [[Venous sinus thrombosis|CVST]]
#### Nasopharynx carcinoma invading through the skull base
### Focal lesion at the cavernous sinus -> as part of [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]]
### [[Diabetic neuropathy]] -> [[Mononeuritis multiplex]]

Mechanism: There are multiple causes of abducens nerve damage → paresis of ipsilateral lateral rectus
- Raised ICP pushes the brainstem inferiorly -> stretching the 6th nerve over the petrous tip

Abducens nerve palsy is the most common ‘false localising sign’ in elevated intracranial pressure.
