# Triple response of: bradycardia, Hypertension and irregular respiratory rate (Cheyenne stokes breathing)
## Includes:
### [[Hypertension]], [[Bradycardia]]
### [[Irregular breathing]]
#### [[Cheyne-Stokes breathing]] -> [[Agonal breathing]]
### [[Wide pulse pressure|Widening pulse pressure]]
## Part of:
### [[Raised ICP]] 

---
**Mechanism:** Raised ICP → compression on brainstem → ischaemia of the hypothalamus → hypothalamic homeostatic response to rescue brain from ischemia → initial sympathetic activation → HTN + tachycardia → baroreceptor reflex → vagally mediated paraympathetic actvity tot he heart → bradycardia
**Seen in:** #Neuro , #Trauma

The prescence of all three features of the triad is a late sign of increased ICP and indicative of → **imminent brainstem herniation.**

- There are multiple signs of increased ICP which should be recognised beforehand: 
	- [[Raised ICP headache]]
	- [[Nausea and vomiting]]
	- [[Altered mental status]]
- The initial stage of Cushing's reflex should be actively looked for in suspect raised ICP: [[Hypertension]], [[Sinus tachycardia]]
	- Hypothalamic ischaemia induces reflexive sympathetic outflow
	- This is to physiologically overcome the raised ICP reducing cerebral perfusion pressure, allowing for brain perfusion as long as the ICP is not too high such that the MAP cannot increase to match
- Tachycardia turns to bradycardia and indicates terminal changes of raised ICP:
    - This is because of → baroreceptor activation resulting in vagus activation of the heart OR direct compression of vagus activating APs towards the heart
- Final sign of shallow breaths with occasional periods of apnoea (sometimes can get a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern) → eventually transitioning to agonal breathing
    - Due to distortion of respiratory brainstem centres from obtundation
