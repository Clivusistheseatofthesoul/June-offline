# [[Lithium]] has a narrow therapeutic index 
## Clinical features:
### [[Headache]] and general fatigue with [[Polydipsia]]
### Systemic and neurologic symptoms will slowly creep up:
#### [[Generalised myoclonus]], [[Fasciculations]] with confusion and [[Agitation]] -> [[Lithium tremor]]
#### [[Hyper-reflexia]]
#### Nephrogenic [[Diabetes insipidus]] -> [[Polydipsia]], [[Polyuria]] and [[Nocturia]]
### Don't see the GI features until acute on chronic exacerbation-> [[Nausea and vomiting]], [[Diarrhoea]]

### Oftentimes precipiated by renal impairment 
## DDx:
### Concomittant [[AKI]] oftentimes just [[Hypovolaemia]]
#### Any causes of reduced Na+ delivery to the collecting duct like [[Salt restriction]], [[CCF]] etc
### Li with drug interaction
#### Any of the triple whammy -> [[ACEi]], [[ARBs]] [[Thiazide diuretic]], [[NSAIDs]] (not aspirin though)
#### Certain antibiotics -> [[Tetracycline]], [[Metronidazole]]
## Mimics:

## Workup:
### Labs
#### Serum [Li+] > 1mM

## Aetiology
### Li accumulates intracellularly the most in the brain and kidney 

## Pathophysiology
### Brain accumulation
### Li accumulation in collecting duct cells of kidney -> Nephrogenic [[Diabetes insipidus]]
#### Gas GPCR inhibition -> reduced cAMP -> reduced AQP-2 insertion and water reabsorption
### Thyroid gland accumulation -> impaired synthesis and secretion of T3/T4 + Ca resistance 
#### [[Hypothyroidism]]
#### Resistance to Ca2+ from Ca-sensing proteins in parathyroid gland -> [[Hyperparathyroidism]] -> [[Hypercalcaemia]]
