## DDx:
### Depending on the type -> may need to conduct a body wide search for primary tumor -> presentation of autoimmune encephalitis as paraneoplastic syndrome 
#### 
## Treatment is often the same between the different subtypes ^9ffd68
**Treatment**

**Regimen**

**First-line immunotherapy**

 Methylprednisolone

1 g daily, for 3–5 days

 Intravenous immunoglobulin

2 g/kg over 5 days (400 mg/kg/day)

 Plasma exchange/immunoadsorption

1 session every other day for 5–7 cycles

**Second-line immunotherapy**

 Rituximab

375 mg/m2 weekly IV infusion for 4 weeks

 Cyclophosphamide

750 mg/m2 monthly for 3–6 months

**Alternative therapy**

 Tocilizumab

Initially 4 mg/kg, followed by an increase to 8 mg/kg monthly based on clinical response

 Low-dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)

1.5 million IU/day, 4 subcutaneous injections with 3-week interval

**Steroid-sparing agents used for maintenance therapy**

 Azathioprine
