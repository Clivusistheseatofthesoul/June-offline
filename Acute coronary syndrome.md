# High clincial suspicion of acute [[Myocardial infarction]] and/or ischaemia
## Clinical features:
### Classic pain syndrome -> called 'Typical angina'
#### Substernal or LHS chest pain
#### Worsening on exertion
#### Relieved with GTN spray
#### Scoring system:  Scored out of 3 
| Pain syndrome         | Risk factors (only modifiable shown) | Associated Sx         | O/E            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Substernal or LHS     | Diabetes, hypertension               | Presyncope, sweating  | Non-positional |
| Worsening on exertion | Smoking, Obesity                     | Dyspnoea, angor animi | Non-pleuritic     | 
| Relieved with GTN     | Dyslipidaemia                        | N/V                   | Non-tender     |
##### 3 = Typical angina
##### 2 = Atypical angina
##### 1 = Non-angina chest pain 
Brief fleeting pain for seconds which dosen't come back with exertion is not ischaemia in aetiology

### Angina -> classic picture of chest pain associated with coronary artery narrowing
#### Central substernal crushing chest pain which radiates to the left axilla and to the jaw
### Angina equivalent -> silent MI or ischaemia without classic pain syndrome
#### Long term diabetics -> will not have pain 
#### Female, elderly or indigneous 
### Unstable angina -> chest pain at rest which worsens with exertion 
### Risk factors:
#### Non-modifiable
#### Modifiable factors -> [[Cigarette smoke]], [[T2DM]] and [[T1DM]], [[Dyslipidaemia]], [[Hypertension]], [[Central adiposity]], Psychosocial stress
#### Modifiable protective factors -> Fruit and vege intake, excercise, alcohol
### Use risk calculator and coronary calcium on imaging as independent predictors 
## Approach: Identical to [[Acute chest pain]]
### People with chest pain at rest should immediately present to ED by ambulance (can do ECG)
#### Other associated features include: Diaphoresis, acute dyspnoea, palpitations and syncopal features
### Consider other acute and emergent DDx -> [[Acute chest pain]]
### Everybody with central non-pleuritic chest pain gets an ECG + initial *MONA*
#### If STEMI -> go straight to Cath lab **EMERGENTLY**
#### If no ST segment elevation -> look at cardiac enzymes
### Troponins for first encounter, CK-MB for re-infarction
#### When they havent returned its -> NSTE-ACS -> stratify risk before troponins return
![[Pasted image 20210125012230.png]]
##### These need serial ECGs and a serial troponin 3hr after symptom onset
#### If high risk or demonstrated NSTEMI (elevated enzymes, no ST elevation) -> initiate *BASH C* for medical stabalisation + still go to Cath lab but **urgently **
#### Angiogram within 24hrs
### Is this ACS at all? Conduct a cardiac stress test to retratify risk
#### There are contraindications to cardiac stress testing:
##### Recurrent chest pain, elevated troponin, severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
#### If ischaemic changes -> high risk -> still go to Cath lab but **electively**
#### If not consider a mimic + follow-up with GP
## DDx:
### [[STEMI]] -> [[Myocardial infarction]]
###  Unstable angina and [[NSTEMI]] -> myocardial ischaemia
## Mimics:

# Tx
## Medical management -> *MON**A BAS**H C*
### Morphine
#### Worsening pain -> exacerbates ischaemia
### O2
#### If saturating under 95% in room air
### +/- Nitrates -> only if ongoing stable angina
#### Sublingual or IV
### **A**spirin
#### 300mg
### **B**eta blocker -> if contraindicated then use cardiac specific CCB
#### Use isolated B1 blocker -> 25mg [[Metoprolol]] *bd*
### **A**CEi
### **S**tatin
#### 80mg Atorvatstatin
### Heparin
#### IV unfractionated heparin or SC LMWH E.g [[Clexane]]
### +/- Clopidogrel -> only if they are getting a stent or high risk/NSTEMI/STEMI getting clot busting 
#### 300-600mg depending on whether they're stenting
### Patient is always going to discharged with ***ABAS***
## Main vessel or 3+ vessels occluded -> CABG
## If only 1 or 2 vessels -> stent
## Secondary prevention
### Calculate absolute risk score -> Framingham risk score
