# Trinucleotide repeat disorder manifesting as fulminant neurodegeneration with anticipation 
## Subtypes:
### Juvenile onset -> [[Westphal variant HD]]
## Clinical features:
### Early manifestations are neuropsychiatric -> Personality change, [[Attentional deficit]] often on a long history of 'fidgeting'
#### early signs on exam -> [[Slowed saccades]]
### Distal [[Chorea]] and [[Athetosis]] -> progressing to spread into bilateral generalised choreiform movements and [[Postural instability]]
#### Psychiatric features also worsen -> [[Avolition]], [[Major depressive disorder]]
## DDx:
### 
## Mimics:
### Sydenham chorea
### Neuroferritinopathy
### SCA
## Workup:
### Laboratory workup to rule out autoimmune causes:
#### ANA as CTD screen -> SLE, Sjogrens, APS, vasculitis
### MRI to confirm atrophy of caudate head and r/o SCA
---
# Tx
## Genetic testing and counselling
## Dampen chorea with anti-dopamine drug -> [[Tetrabenazine]] or an antipsychotic
### Antipsychotics are used if TBZ is not tolerated -> be careful of [[Tardive syndromes]]
## Treat depression and other psychiatric manifestations
## Discussion of end-of-life issues and pall care team before communication ability becomes lost 
# Monitering
## Discontinue anti-dopamine drug if no longer providing any aid
---
## Complications
### [[Dysphagia]] -> [[Aspiration]] -> [[Pneumonia]] -> most common cause of death for HD patients
### [[Major depressive disorder]] -> [[Suicide]] is unfortunately common

---
## Aetiology
### Inherited autosomal dominant trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion of *Huntington* gene (Chromosome 4p16.3)
#### Number of repeats predicts age of onset (40+ being complete penetrance) and paternal transmission increases repeat length
## Pathophysiology
### Neurodegeneration of enkephalin spiny neurons in the lentiform nucleus

#### Cases
Mr BZ is a 40y/o male janitor (with unknown handedness) whom presents with insidious onset 'fidgeting' and inappropriate, impulsive behavior over the last few years. He previously had good work attendance but his workers have noticed a recent behavioral shift and fidgeting which has recently spread to jerky movements of his entire body. His father reportedly had similar behavioral and movement alterations before died at age 58 of a MVA. He is alert but with deficits in maintaining attention. His short term recall was intact. He is mildly disequilibric but able to stand independently. Walking brings out involuntary distal hand movements. Reflexes brisk bilaterally with upgoing plantars.
In summary Mr BZ is a 40y/o man presenting with insidious onset attentional deficit and distal athetosis which has progressed to symmetrical choreiform movements on a significant family history of a similar movement disorder with anticipation. This is strongly suggestive of a TNR movement disorder -> specificically Huntington's disease.
