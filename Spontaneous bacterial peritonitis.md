# Bacterial infection of the peritoneal fluid without surgical aetiology E.g bowel perforation, biliary sepsis etc
## Clinical features:
### Presents very differently to classical peritonitis -> not acute abdominal pain and peritoneal signs 
#### Typically diffuse vague abdominal pain with mild abdominal tenderness without rigidity
#### Systemic signs -> [[Fever]] and [[Altered mental status]]
### MedHx
#### Concurrent use of [[PPI]] increases risk
## DDx:
### Almost always cirrhotic -> [[Chronic liver disease]]
### Rarely in non-cirrhotics -> seeding from [[UTI]], bacteraemia 
### Most commonly caused by:
#### [[E. coli]], [[K. pneumoniae|Kleb]] but also [[S. pneumoniae]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Diagnosed by paracentesis 
#### Perform if liver disease with ascites presents with any GI symptom (vomiting/diarrhoea) or AMS or fever without compelling diagnosis
#### Cell count with differential 
#### Gram stain and culture
##### Not actually for dx of SBP -> more for abx susceptibilities 
### More likely to be secondary peritonitis if
#### 2 or more organisms on stain
#### SAAG < 1.1
### Types of SBP defined by ascitic fluid labs -> should you treat?
#### Elevated PMNs + -ve culture -> Culture-negative neutrocytic ascites (CNNA)
##### Always treat
#### Normal or low PMNS + +ve culture -> Bacterascites 
##### If symptomatic treat
##### If asymptomatic -> watch and wait

# Antibiotic Tx
## Stop any non-selective [[Beta blocker]]
## Start abx immediately after paracentesis if clinical suspicion is high
### Need enteric gram -ves and strep coverage -> Ceftriaxone or ceftaxime
#### IV 2g ceftriaxone daily for 5 days unless unusual organism or persistent symptoms
## Wait for ascitic fluid cell count if clinical suspicion is low (only takes 1-2hrs)

# Prevention of hepatorenal syndrome
## Give IV albumin
### IV 1.5g/kg albumin infusion immediately when diagnosed with SBP
### At 48hrs post diagnosis -> provide another IV 1g/kg albumin infusion

---
## Complications
### SBP can trigger -> [[Hepatorenal syndrome]]

---
## Aetiology
### Cirrhosis -> increased susceptibility of infecting ascitic fluid 
#### Altered small bowel motility
#### Increased bowel permeability -> bacterial translocation through lymph nodes
#### Reduced protein production -> reduced complement levels and PMN function -> acquired immune deficiency
## Pathophysiology

---
#### Cases
