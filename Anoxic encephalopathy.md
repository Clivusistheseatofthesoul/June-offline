#### Cases
Mr H is a 35M australian re-patriot from america after successful CPR  was left with severe neurological disability from assumed anoxic encephalopathy. His vocabularu was restricted to "no, thank you" and "stop it" although he could utilise these two phrases with entirely different intonations to evoke different severities of requests. Over the next few weeks he had a mild recovery: sometimes he said "Hi, Good morning!" to the nurse in the morning.
