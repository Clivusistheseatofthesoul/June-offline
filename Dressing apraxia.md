# Automatic, spontaneous capacity for self-dressing is lost -> arms will go through the wrong holes when given a gown
## Description:
### Inability to dress correctly is often used as a bedside screening tool to identify need for further visuospatial assessment
## DDx:
### Secondary to [[Anton-Babinski syndrome]], [[Unilateral inattention]], [[Left-right confusion]], [[Somatic illusions|Body-schema disturbance]]

**Mechanism: **Destructive lesion to the #Inferior_parietal_lobule on the #non-dominant hemisphere 
- Vascular supply by: #ICA → #MCA (M1) → MCA-M2/3 (anterior or middle trunk) -> MCA-M4 as #angular_artery 

**Seen in:** #Neuro #Ischaemia

This is technically a misnomer as it can be caused by two different mechanisms: 
1. inattention to the left side during dressing → visuospatial neglect of the body
2. Constructional apraxia -> inability to rotate schematic representation of object correctly to put on shirt
