Mechanism: Reduced bone mass index can be caused by various disturbances
1. Gut:
- Reduce ca absorption, vitamin D absorption
- vitamin D intake

2. Kidney:
- Increase ca losses

3. Bones:
- Reduce numbers of replacement osteoblasts
- Reduced IGF1 GF incorporation into matrix -> reduced coupling
- Reduced osteoblast and osteocyte viability -> bone is more prone to fracture for any given bone mass

4. Endocrine:
- [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
