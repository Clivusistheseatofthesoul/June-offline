# Any disease affecting the pulmonary interstitium characterised by inflammation and fibrosis -> excluding infectious and neoplastic diseases
## Classification:
### Exposure related
#### Organic -> [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]]
#### Non-organic -> [[Pneumoconiosis]]
#### Radiation -> [[Radiation pneumonitis]]
#### Medication side effect -> [[Medication-induced ILD]]
### Secondary to [[Connective tissue diseases]] -> these will present with pathology of one of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias
#### [[Systemic sclerosis]], [[Rheumatoid arthiritis]], [[Polymyositis]], [[Dermatomyositis]]
#### Least likely -> [[SLE]]
### Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias
#### [[Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] -> pathologically is usual interstitial pneumonia
#### [[Non-specific interstitial pneumonia]]
### Others
#### Vasculitides -> [[Granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]]
#### Hypersensitivity reactions -> [[Eosinophilic pneumonia]]
#### Infiltrative disease -> [[Sarcoidosis]], [[Langerhan's histiocytosis]]
## Common clinical findings:
### Chronic, progressive and constant dyspnoea, [[Dry cough]]
### [[Fine crackles]]
## Ix
### CXR

### CT thorax with thin cuts (HRCT thorax)
#### honeycombing, ground glass opacities (attenuation which does not obscure vessels and airways), consolidation, 'crazy paving or cobblestoning'
### PFTs
#### Restrictive pattern
1. Normal or reduced FEV1
2. Reduced FVC
3. Normal or **elevated** FEV1/FVC 
#### Reduced diffusing capacity -> reduced DLCO -> cause of the [[Hypoxaemia]]
## Complications
### [[Pulmonary hypertension]]
