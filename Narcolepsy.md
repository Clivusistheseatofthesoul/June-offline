## Clinical features:
### Narcolepsy alone presents with [[Excessive daytime sleepiness]] early on
#### Irresistable urge to sleep with mini-sleep attacks of < 30mins which occur in inappropriate situtations E.g while driving, doing tests etc
#### Occur despite normal sleep duration at night 
### Narcolepsy can also present with associated features: of note [[Cataplexy]]
#### Abnormal REM sleep activation -> [[Cataplexy]] -> sudden loss of muscle tone and consciousness triggered by strong emotions or food
##### Can be partial (more common) or complete
##### Must be resolved within 2 minutes -> however it can be followed immediately by a sleep attack 
#### Abnormal REM sleep -> [[Sleep paralysis]]
#### Sleep hallucinations
##### [[Hypnagogic hallucinations]] -> vivid formed hallucinations occuring before falling asleep
##### [[Hypnopompic hallucinatios]] -> vivid formed hallucinations upon waking up
#### Automatic behavior
##### E.g., a patient may find themselves in a room with a cup of tea and no memory of having made the tea or entering the room
## DDx:
### Primary narcolepsy
#### Type 1 -> Partially inherited + streptococcal pharyngitis/H1N1 vaccine exposure
#### Type 2 -> Idiopathic
### Secondary narcolepsy
#### Hypothalamic compression -> Suprasellar mass E.g [[Craniopharyngioma]]
#### Hypothalamic infiltration
#### Hypothalamic inflammation -> [[NMOSD]]
#### Hypothalamic dysplasia -> [[Prader-willi syndrome]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis
---
# Tx
## Lifestyle intervention to minimise impact of daytime sleep intrusions
## Persisting daytime sleepiness -> [[Modafinil]] or another CNS stimulant 
---
## Complications
###

---
## Aetiology
### Type 1 narcolepsy is caused by an aberrant immune response to typically streptococcal pharyngitis or the flu vaccine -> immune mimicry of hypothalamic orexinergic neurons 
## Pathophysiology
### Destruction of lateral hypothalamic nucleus orexinergic neurons
