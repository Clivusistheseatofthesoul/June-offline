# Ipsilateral weakness of head turn against resistence at the jaw

## DDx:
### [[Malingering]] and penetrating trauma of the neck

---
Mechanism: #Posterior_triangle_of_the_neck destructive lesion -> cutting into #CN_XI -> Weakness in the ipsilateral ScM results in reduced ability to turn away from that muscle
Seen in: #CL_psych, #Trauma

The accessory nerve is most often palsied due to penetrating injury to the posterior triangle of the neck

- it is also caused by local mass lesions in the posterior triangle
- Iatrogenically during surgery

400IQ play: The test for ScM weakness is fantastic for detecting malingering as normally you would always assume the opposite muscle pulls the head over!
