# Anti-psychotics
## Includes:
### 2nd generation or [[Atypical anti-psychotics]] -> work on both positive and negative features of psychosis by partial blockade of dopamine and serotonin
#### Used when extra-pyramidal side effects of concern
#### If parkinsonism/lew body dementia of concern
#### If dementia -> typically respiridone for short term
### 1st generation or [[Typical anti-psychotics]] -> only work on positive features of psychosis by blockade of dopamine only
## Indications:
### [[Psychosis]]
| Patient cohort                                                   | Medication to use            |                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compliant patient who wants to take meds to stop their psychosis | [[Atypical anti-psychotics]] | [[Quetiapine]], [[Risperidone]], [[Olanzapine]]                 |
| Combative patient in the ED                                      | IM forms                     | [[Haloperidol]] first line; sometimes [[Olanzapine]] sublingual |
| Patient who has [[Dysphagia]]                                    | Oral dissolving pill         | [[Olanzapine]], [[Risperidone]]                                 |
| Non-compliant patient who always forgets to take their meds      | Depot forms                  | [[Aripiprazole]], [[Risperidone]]                                         |
| When all else fails                                              | [[Clozapine]]                | [[Clozapine]]                                                   |

## Side effects:

### Blockade of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway results in: 
#### Acute
##### Acutely over days they can also get a Drug-induced [[Dystonia]] -> [[Cervical dystonia|Spasmodic torticollis]], [[Oculogyric crisis]], [[Pseudomacroglossia]]
To resolve:
- Give any of the following:
	- Anti-cholinergic -> Benzdripene
##### Acutely over days-weeks can get a symmetrical drug-induced [[Akathisia]]
To resolve:
- Reduce the dose
- Give one of the following:
	- Non-selective beta-blocker
	- Benzdripene or another Anti-cholinergic

##### Acutely over days-weeks can also get a [[Drug-induced Parkinsonism]]
To resolve:
- Give any of the following:
	- Anti-cholinergic -> Benzdripene
#### Sub-acutely can get [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] over days-weeks
#### Chronic 
##### Chronically can get [[Tardive syndromes]] over mounths-years 
Screen patients on anti-psychotics and stop the offending anti-psychotic
### Blockade of the tubuloinfundibular pathway results in:
#### [[Gynaecomastia]] in men, [[Galactorrhea]] and [[Secondary Amenorrhea]] in women
### Dirty [[Histaminergic blockade|blockade of histamine]] pathways results in:
#### [[Drug induced sedation]]
### Dirty [[Cholinergic blockade|blockade of the acetylcholinergic]] pathways results in:
#### [[Dry eyes]], [[Dry mouth]], [[Urinary retention]]
#### All of them can give you [[QT prolongation]] -> [[Long-QT syndrome]]
# Countra indications
# Administration 
# Monitering 
## Before and after administration:
### need a ECG to r/o QT prolongation
## Routine screening for tardive syndromes
### Stop the offending medication if suggestion of tardive syndrome
