Aliases: Behcet's syndrome, Silk road disease

# Idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease with diverse systemic manifestations
## Clinical features:
### Most defining clinical feature is recurrent painful mucocutaneous [[Ulcers]] -> typically [[Oral ulcer]] -> 3+ over last year
#### Recurrent [[Genital ulcers]] -> these heal but will scar
### Typically found in 'Silk road countries'
### There are 4 syndromes depending on system involvement:
#### Dermatological -> Acneiform eruptions, pseudofolliculitis, [[Erythema nodosum]]
#### Eyes -> [[Anterior uveitis]], [[Retinal vasculitis]]
#### MSK -> Typically asymmetric, oligoarticular large joint arthritis
#### Blood -> [[DVT]], [[Budd Chiari syndrome]], [[Venous sinus thrombosis|CVST]]
#### Vascular -> thrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis
#### There are other more rare
#### CNS -> Encephalitis, CN palsies, ataxia, myelopathy
#### GI -> diarrhoea and GI bleeding, ileocaecal crohn like ulcers
## DDx:
### Idiopathic cause although Sx tend to cluster into 4 groups which all have different treatment regimens:

## Mimics:
### Inflammatory bowel diseases
### SLE
### Reactive arthritis
## Workup:
### Clinical diagnosis solely on history and exam ± pathergy test
#### Recurrent oral and genital ulcers already is quite specific for Behcet's 
#### Positive pathergy test -> skin prick with 20G needle
##### Papule or pustule like lesion after 48hrs -> if done in the mouth will result in an oral ulcer

# Sx Tx for dermatological and MSK behcet's
## [[Oral ulcer|Ulcer]] relief
### Acutely is treated with topical corticosteroid
### Prophylaxis with [[Colchicine]] -> if refractory -> [[Azathioprine|Azithioprine]]
## Inflammatory arthritis
### [[Colchicine]] ± [[NSAIDs]] 
### If refractory -> [[Azathioprine|Azithioprine]] and/or [[Anti-TNF antibodies]]
## Derm lesions
### Topical corticosteroid + [[Colchicine]]
### If refractory -> Derm referral
# Sx Tx for ocular and Neurobehcet's
## Opthal lesions
### Opthal referral
## Neuro-behcets
### Corticosteroids + [[Azithioprine]]
# Sx Tx for GI behcet's
## GI-behcets
### [[Corticosteroids]] + [[Sulfasalazine]] and/or [[Azithioprine]]
