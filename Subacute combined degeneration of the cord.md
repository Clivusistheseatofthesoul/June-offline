# Combined demyelinating degeneration of the posterior and lateral funiculi due classically to B12 unavailability -> often occuring with a b12 related neuropathy
## Clinical features:
### Earliest presenting features are related to peripheral neuropathy -> Constant tingling symmetrical [[Paresthesia]] in the LL > UL
### Combined Posterior funicular demyelination
#### Symmetrical parasthesia progresses to a [[Sensory ataxia]] with a [[Romberg's sign]]
### with lateral funiculus demyelination
#### Earliest is bilaterally +ve [[Babinsksi's sign]] -> full picture of upper motor neurons lesion is prevented by concommitant neuropathy
##### With neuropathy -> the classic early picture is -> persistent distal LL paresthesia with [[Absent reflexes]] in the lower limb Â± extensor babinski's
#### Eventually progresses to [[Spastic paraparesis|Spastic paraplegia]] or [[Flaccid paraplegia]] with [[Urinary incontinence]]
