# 
## Clinical features:
### [[Wheezing]], [[wet cough]] and typically shallow 'useless' breathing -> [[Acute Dyspnoea]] typically with onset of hours-days
#### Those with dyspnoea, cough and increased sputum production -> most likely benefit from empiric abx
### Past COPD history esp. past PFTs
#### Extensive smoking history
#### Assess severity with COPD history:
##### Use Home O2?
##### # of inhaled medications they're on
##### Have they been intubated for COPD before?
### Look for triggers
#### bacterial pneumonia
#### Respiratory viruses
#### Air pollution and fire season
#### med non-adherence
### [[Tripod position]] speaking in short sentences with a wheeze -> other features of [[Respiratory distress]]
#### Look for features of pneumonia on chest exam
## DDx:
### Bacterial infections -> most common cause overall is [[H. influenzae]]
### Viral infections (30% of causes) -> [[Common cold]], [[Flu]]
## Mimics:
### Pulmonary embolism!
### Bacterial and viral pneumonia
### Heart failure
## Workup:
### Confirm [[COPD]] diagnosis and severity
#### Use COPD history to determine severity
#### Everyone gets a CXR, **ABG** and ECG to rule out mimics
##### Respiratory acidosis (the acidaemia determines the status of exacerbation) -> must be on BiPAP
If their CO2 continues to go higher despite BiPAP -> tube-em
#### Consider PE workup if:
##### HIghly abrupt onset within minutes
##### [[Acute Dyspnoea]] being the only symptom
##### Pleuritic chest pain
##### Active malignancy
##### history of DVTs
##### ABG revealing **reduced PaCO2 than baseline**!
#### For PE workup -> If Wells score is usually < 4 -> just d-dimer should be fine
### If flu like -> should always get a nasopharyngeal swab and PCR
### Only those at risk of bacterial pneumonia get a sputum culture
#### Even then it often does not alter management as COPD'ers are persistently colonised by several organisms
### No-one gets a PFT -> nobody will be able to complete it...

# Response to empirical Tx determines severity of exacerbation
## Give O2
### Target is just like chronic COPD -> 88-92%
## Acute broncodilation
### Nebulised SABA and SAMA
## Give corticosteroids
### If you don't think they need ICU -> PO prednisone
## Withold Abx in most cases -> use only if it is a severe bacterial infection
### PO Doxycyclin or amoxicillin alone if
#### All 3 criteria for infection are present:
1. Increased sputum volume
2. Prescence of sputum purulence or a change in sputum colour
3. Fever
#### AND the exacerbation is severe -> admission into ICU
##### For patients managed in the **intensive care** unit, antibiotics significantly reduce the rate of treatment failure and reduce mortality -> in no other circumstance is there evidence that abx speeds up recovery
### Lack of response -> escalate to broad spectrum
## Always provide anti-virals if PCR +ve for viral infection
### PO [[Oseltamivir]] or Inhaled [[Zanamivir]]

# If they respond to empirics -> mild COPD exacerbation -> discharge + outpatient followup
## if they worsen -> severe COPD exacerbation -> ICU
## if no significant changes -> moderate COPD exacerbation -> admit
# Hospital management of the mod-severe COPD exacerbation

# Followup with discharge
## Smoking cessation counselling
## Vaccination
## Evaluate for home O2 
### 6min walk test just before discharge -> If PaO2 < 55 and SpO2 < 88% -> take home O2
## Follow up pulmonary rehab
## Palliative care consult before discharge
# Secondary prevention of exacerbation
## Action plan when sick
### Having access to oral abx and prednisone for emergency situations when they are infected with the cold or flu 
### Directions on how to increase SABA pre-emptively

## Complications
### Associated with [[Acute coronary syndrome]] in the 5 days following the exacerbation
