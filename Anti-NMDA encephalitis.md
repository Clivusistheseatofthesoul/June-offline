### No psychiatric history -> presenting with frank [[Psychosis]]
### Resistant and progressive to anti-psychotics -> Worsening cognitive deficit + [[Seizures]] and [[Orofacial dyskinesia]]
#### Oftentimes memory deficits -> [[Agnosias]], [[Delusional mis-identification syndromes]] like [[Capgras delusion]]
### Later features also -> [[Autonomic failure]] -> derranged BP and HR
## DDx:
### Autoimmune
### Paroneoplastic (E.g first ever case was Young woman with underlying [[Ovarian teratoma]])
## Mimics:
### Subacute course of encephalitis of infectious aetiology
## Workup:
### LP -> CSF study with viral serology -> takes 1 week to return -> start IV acyclovir if high suspicion
### EEG -> encephalitis have an abnormal EEG as opposed to Schizophrenia

# Tx
See [[Autoimmune encephalitis#Treatment is often the same between the different subtypes|General treatment for autoimmune encephalitis]]

## Acute immunosuppression
### Plasma exchange, intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) or high-dose IV corticosteroids are often used in concert
### If refractory -> B cell blockade -> [[Rituximab]]
## Systemic search for tumor + resection

## Complications
###

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### NMDA antagonism in the thalamus -> disinhibition of the frontal cortex

#### Cases
Ms AY is a 28F psychiatric inpatient whom is asked for a consult for a first seizure on a background of new onset psychosis. There is no history of psychiatric disease, this is her first psychotic episode and it occured on a context of "the flu" occuring a few weeks before onset of a paranoid psychosis. The psychosis was accompanied by abnormal mouth and tongue movements. Anti-psychotics reduced her auditory hallucinations; however, her cognition is progressively worsening and she is now hypersomnolent. On entering the room, the patient was sleeping and only rousable with painful peripheral stimulus. She is confused and does not participate for a formal neurologic examination. She has dyskinetic movements of the mouth and tongue. Her BP and pulse fluctuate wildly.
