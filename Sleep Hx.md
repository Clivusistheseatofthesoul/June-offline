# Good sleep hygiene
1. Getting up at same time everyday
2. Excercise during the day not just before sleep
3. Avoid stimulants -> caffiene
4. Winding down sacred period -> no screens, meditate

# Stimulus control
## The bed is associated with nothing but sleeping -> no reading, no nothing
# Sleep restriction 
## Sleep diary of time they are asleep 
Count the # hours you actually sleep and discount the non-productive ones
- make that the limit of time in bed

Then once they are efficient at a specific time
- shift it back in 15-30min intervals
