# Visual phenomena without external visual stimulus
## Classification: hallucinatory content varies accordingly to irritation or excitation in the relevant visual processing area
### Globe tinting -> [[Deus-Ex Human Revolution filter]] 
### Occipital pole -> [[Phosphenes]]
### Visual association areas an early Ventral stream -> [[Fortification spectra]] as seen in [[Migraine headache]]
#### Other visual phenomenon of visual migraines include -> Exploding phosphenes, like rainy windows on one side
### Late ventral stream -> [[Formed visual hallucinations]] -> extreme end of stream (MTL activation) -> Fixed tableu like familiar frames I.e [[Deja vu]]
### Ventral and dorsal stream junction -> [[Somatic illusions]] and [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]]
## DDx: Visual hallucinations are more caused by organic disease than non-organic diseases
### visual hallucinations of ‘nets’ were said to characterise the organic reactions seen in bromide intoxication although this is now rare

## Cases
A 56-year-old woman suffered three epileptic attacks in the wake of visual hallucinations over a 4 year period. Many times a year, over that time, the visual hallucinations consisted of alternating flashing yellow triangles, having an effect rather like flashing temporary roadworks indicators. If the yellow triangle remained upside down no fit would occur but on the three occasions when alternate triangles became upright, within 30 seconds of the change she convulsed. No underlying lesion could be demonstrated and all the symptoms disappeared when she was started on carbamazepine
