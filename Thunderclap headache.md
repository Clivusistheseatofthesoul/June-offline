# Abrupt-onset headache that is maximal in seconds but may develop in minutes often with extreme severity described as "[[Worst headache i've ever had]]" 
## DDx:
### [[Subarachnoid haemorrhage]], [[Pituitary apoplexy]]
### [[RCVS]], [[Carotid dissection]]
### Sometimes caused by [[Venous sinus thrombosis|Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]]
### Some CNS infections can also create the same picture -> [[Acute complicated sinusitis]], [[Pyogenic meningitis]]
### Hypertensive headache can also present similarly -> [[Hypertensive headache]] and [[PRES]]

## Mimics
### Exploding head syndrome, other benign headache syndromes E.g Crash headache, Ice-pick headache

## Workup
### If they are pregnant -> urgent workup for [[Pre-eclampsia]]
### Imaging
### If imaging is negative -> followup with LP
### If LP negative -> MR-B with MR-A and MR-V

Sign: 

Thunderclap headache (aka sentinel headache) is classically associated with a sub-arachnoid hearmorrhage from an aneurysm that is just about to burst (hence sentinel). However many other things can also cause it, some of them secondary in aetiology and also requiring rapid intervention, others are primary in nature and require only supportive therapy

- **Red-flags** for SAH in 'thunderclap headache' presentation
    - Worst worst worstest of worst headache ever
    - First ever episode that onseted with exertion E.g Sexual intercourse
    - Progressive neurological deterioration or alertness
    - Abnormal neurological exam

            - Bradycardia
            - Hypertension
            - irregular breathing

        - Subhyaloid haemorrhages on fundoscopy
        - [Papiloedema](Papiloedema%20685da54d945148a8a1ff3ee1298b8577.md) on fundoscopy (caused by raised ICP → late sign)
- Thunderclap headache is referred to as sentinel headache if a aneurysm is detected → because the cause is likely from leakage through the aneurysm
- Red-flags for pituitary apoplexy
    - Sudden onset, mass effect like headache + vomiting + diplopia
