# An [[IBD]]
## Clinical features:
###  [[Chronic diarrhoea|Chronic]] [[Bloody diarrhoea]] which is [[urgent|Bowel urge incontinence]]
#### Asssociated with [[Tenesmus]]
#### Sometimes with associated LLQ pain 
#### Red flag is [[Nocturnal diarrhoea]]
### Other manifestations:
#### Eyes -> [[Red eye]], [[Dry eyes]], [[Photophobia]]
##### Due to [[Anterior uveitis|Anterior uveitis]]
#### Skin -> Rashes esp. [[Erythema nodosum]] and [[Pyoderma gangrenosum]]
#### Joints -> [[Joint pain|Arthritis]] with [[Arthralgia]]
##### Proximal joint asymmetrical oligoarticularlarge joint arthritis commonly occurs with acute GI presentation
##### Low back joint pain -> [[Enteropathic arthiritis]]
##### Symmetrical polyarticularsmall joint arthritis often occurs independent of disease activity
#### Extra-bowel GI involvement -> Sx of [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis]] 
### Systemic manifestations
#### [[Unintentional weight loss]] and [[Reduced appetite]] with general malaise
### On inspection
#### [[Clubbing]]
### Eyes
#### [[Iritis]], [[Episcleritis]], [[Scleritis]]
## DDx:
###
## Mimics:
### Infectious enterocolitis
## Workup:
### If flare -> need to do labs
#### ESR and CRP elevation -> systemic response -> need to check for [[Megacolon|Toxic megacolon]]
##### LFT looking for PSC
##### PT and APTT just in case of bleeding disorder
##### FBC and Iron if bleeding
#### Stool microscopy, cultures and PCR
### Imaging
#### AXR if systemic involvement to check for megacolon
#### CT if suspecting bowel obstruction or fistula/abcess
#### OR
#### CT-E if stronlgy suspicious of IBD
### Some form of endoscopy when stable
#### Typically flexible sigmoidoscopy next day

# Tx
## Acute bloody diarrhoea with urgency presenting to hospital
### Stool sample -> testing
#### It will not be abnormal for someone to have both infetious enterocolitis and IBD at the same time
### Start empiricals in ED
#### IV ciprofloxacin, metronidazole (amoeba coverage)
#### IV hydrocortisone 100mg QID -> empirical for IBD
### Fasted overnight for scope day after
### If they do not respond to acute burst steroids
#### Directly start IV 5mg/kg infliximab over 2 hrs
# Before starting Immunosuppressants
## Vaccination and serology screening 
### IBD patients on immunosuppressants/modulators are at an increased risk of certain infections
#### Most common being reactivation of [[Tuberculosis]] and [[Hep B]]
#### Screen additionally for -> strongyloides, Varicella, HPV
## Administer live vaccines before starting tx

# Induction of Immunosuppression
## [[ASA]]s are first line
### Sulfasalazine is often poorly tolerated so start [[5-ASA]]
#### PO 5-ASA with 
##### rectal mesalazine enema/suppository if active proctitis/distal colitis
##### PO prednisolone short course (taper over 6-8 weeks) if extensive UC (beyond splenic flexure)
[[Budesonide]] is available but is not PBS reimbursed for UC (only for crohn's) :( 
### Moniter with bloods after 1 month then every 6 months
## If no response to ASA and PO steroid short course -> remove steroids and replace with immunomodulator as a bridge to biologics
### PO 5-ASA with Azithioprine or MTX + folate
## If still no response -> Infliximab/adalimumab or new boi Vedolizumab
### IV infliximab 5mg/kg frequent dosing -> maintainence dosing 

# Maintainence immunosuppression

## Complications
### Severe acute flare -> [[Megacolon|Toxic megacolon]]
### [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis]] in 4% of patients
### [[Colorectal cancer]]
