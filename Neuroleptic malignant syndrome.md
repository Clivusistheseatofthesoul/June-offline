# 
## Clinical features:
### Someone on Anti-psychotics with febrile illness and generalised muscle rigidity
#### Typically occurs within 2 weeks of starting the first dose of anti-psychotic -> **not associated with increased duration of therapy**
#### Tetrad of signs
##### Fever
##### Confusion
##### Muscle rigidity
##### Autonomic instability -> Generalised [[Hyperhydrosis|Diaphoresis]], Sinus tachycardia, tachypnoea and [[Labile blood pressure]]
#### Other signs include: Generalised reduced stretch reflexes
## DDx:
### Recent start on a new [[Anti-psychotics]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Increased serum CK

---
# Tx
## Discontinue any potentially triggering medication

# Symptomatic Tx
## Start [[Dantrolene]] to reduce temperature and risk of evolving into rhabdomyolysis
## Start IV fluids to prevent imminent AKI
## Patients need to be transfered to a medical or ICU ward  
# Prevent bad outcome
## Search for co-exisiting medical co-morbidity
### [[AKI]]
### Aspiration [[Pneumonia]]

---
## Complications
### [[Rhabdomyolysis]] -> [[AKI]]

## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology

#### Typically occurs within 2 weeks of starting the first dose of anti-psychotic -> **not associated with increased duration of therapy**
#### Tetrad of signs
##### Fever -> [[Hyperpyrexia]]
##### Confusion
##### Generalised [[Lead-pipe rigidity]] 
##### Autonomic instability leading to derranged vitals -> Generalised [[Hyperhydrosis|Diaphoresis]], Sinus tachycardia, tachypnoea and [[Labile blood pressure]]
#### Other signs include: Generalised reduced stretch reflexes
## DDx:
### Recent start on a new [[Anti-psychotics]]
### Precipitated by recent physical illness, [[Hypovolaemia]]
## Mimics:
### Akinetic-rigid crisis in Parkinson's patients
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Increased serum [CK]
#### [[Generalised leucocytosis]]

## Complications
### [[Rhabdomyolysis]] -> [[AKI]]
