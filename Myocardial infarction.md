# Heart attack
## Clinical features:
| **Pain syndrome **    | **Risk factors (only modifiable shown)** | **Associated Sx**     | **O/E**        | 
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Substernal or LHS     | Diabetes, hypertension                   | Presyncope, sweating  | Non-positional |
| Worsening on exertion | Smoking, Obesity                         | Dyspnoea, angor animi | Non-pleuritic  |
| Relieved with GTN     | Dyslipidaemia                            | N/V                   | Non-tender     |

### Angina -> classic picture of chest pain associated with coronary artery narrowing
#### Central substernal crushing chest pain which radiates to the left axilla and to the jaw
### Angina equivalent -> silent MI or ischaemia without classic pain syndrome
### Unstable angina -> chest pain at rest which worsens with exertion 
### NSTEMI or STEMI is defined by prescence of cardiac enzymes in blood 
|                                       | Asymptomatic CAD | Stable angina (or an angina equivalent) |     | Unstable angina (or an angina equivalent) | NSTEMI       | STEMI                |

| Pain                                  | -                | Central pain on exertion                |     | Pain at rest                              | Pain at rest | Pain at rest         |
| Relieved by                           | -                | Resting, or GTN                         |     | GTN spray                                 | GTN spray    | -                    |
| Prescence of cardiac enzymes in blood | -                | -                                       |     | elevated                                  | elevated     | elevated             |
| ECG - ST segment changes              | -                | -                                       |     | -                                         | -            | ST segment elevation |
| Actual occlusion of artery            | < 50%            | 70%                                     |     | 90%                                       | > 90%        | 100%                 |
### 70% occlusion or greater causes demand ischaemia of the cardiac muscle (blood is insufficient for CO) ; 100% occlusion causes supply ischaemia (no blood coming in at all)

### ECG
#### Axis deviation will tell you which artery is infarcted

### Labs
#### Cardiac enzymes

# Tx
## Post procedure
### Cardiac monitering
### Assess LVEF 
### Renal monitering -> contrast nephropathy
## Secondary prevention
### Take home sublingual GTN spray
### Long term *N ABAS C* therapy
### "Cardiac rehabilitation"

## Complications
### [[Ventricular tachycardia]] and [[Ventricular fibrillation]]
### Heart block
### Ischaemic damage -> myocardial rupture -> [[Acute cardiac tamponade]]
### Depreswsed LVEF or valvular incompetence from capillary muscle necrosis -> [[Cardiogenic shock]]
### Ventricular or aterial aneurysm -> thrombosis -> [[Ischaemic stroke]]
### Chronic inflammation of the cardiomyocytes -> [[Pericardial effusion|pericarditis]]
