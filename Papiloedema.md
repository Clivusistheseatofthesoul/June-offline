# Optic disk swelling due to [[Raised ICP]]
## Description
### Swelling and blurring of the optic disk margin on fundoscopy oftentimes with adjacent haemorrhages and concentric or radiating Paton's lines
#### Earliest change is increased calibre and tortuosity of venous vessels
#### The normal pale disk centre becomes pink
#### Disk margins start to blurr (although nasal edge being little more blurrier than temporal edge is normal)
##### Specifically look at the upper and lower margins 
## DDx:
### Typically a [[Bilateral papiloedema]] -> typically [[Raised ICP]]
#### Other causes
##### [[Hypertensive crisis]]
##### Hypercapnia
##### [[Hypoparathyroidism]] and [[Hypocalcaemia]] -> low Ca2+ esp in children
##### [[Vitamin A toxicity]]
### But occassionally can be a [[Unilateral papilloedema]] -> [[Venous sinus thrombosis]]

Papiloedema can be identified on fundoscopy by:

- blurriness of the optic disk margins
- radial lines eminenating out from the optic disk aka **paton's lines**
- haemorrhages over, under and adjacent to the optic disk
- loss of venous pulsation on doppler
