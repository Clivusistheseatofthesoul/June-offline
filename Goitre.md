# Enlarged thyroid, looks like a central lump below the adams apple -> can be accompanied by associated symptoms and signs of local mass lesion

## Includes:
### [[Dysphonia]] -> even [[Aphonia]]
### [[Dysphagia]] [[Odynophagia]] [[Globus sensation]] 
### [[loud snoring]] [[Apnoeic episodes]] [[Stridor]] 
### [[Pemberton's sign]] 

## Part of:
### [[Thyrotoxicosis]] [[Acromegaly]]

## DDx: 
### [[Hypothyroidism]]  -> [[Iodine deficiency]], [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]
### Euthyroidism -> [[Thyroid cancer]] [[Non-toxic goitre]]
### [[Thyrotoxicosis]] -> [[Grave's disease]]

Mechanism: Any cause inducing hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of the thyroid parenchyma.

Goitre is thyroid gland expansion → which itself can cause signs and symptoms due to compression of nearby structures:

- Superior expansion is limited by sternothyroideus insertion into the thyroid cartilage
- Lateral expansion can compromise the recurrent laryngeal nerves → [[Dysphonia]] and if bilateral → [[Aphonia]]
- Ventral and inferior expansion can compress the:
    - Trachea → [[loud snoring]], [[Apnoeic episodes]] during sleeping, positional [[Acute Dyspnoea]] thats worse when laying down → severe compression (luminal diameter <5mm) → [[Stridor]]
    - Oesophagus → [[Globus sensation]], [Dysphagia ](Dysphagia%2007040b0497dc48928b881159580d79c3.md)  and [[Odynophagia]]
    - Obstruction of neck veins when lifting both arms up → +ve [[Pemberton's sign]]

The goitre is often classified into painful or painless goitre to help sort out differentials:

Goitre does not tell you the activity of thyroid hormones. The causes can be classified by thyroid function:

- [[Hypothyroidism]]
    - Iodine deficiency
    - Hashimoto's disease
        - fibrosis + development of ectopic lymphoid follicles → painless rubbery and asymmetric
    - Thyroiditis
		- Inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release → **painful goitre**
	- Chronic fibrotic
- Euthyroid
    - r/o [[Thyroid cancer]] **→ fine needle bx**
    - Simple non-toxic goitre (Euthyroid Goiter)
		- goiter is typically soft, symmetric, and smooth
- [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
    - Graves disease
		- Homogenous proliferation of all follicular cells → **diffuse painless goitre**
    - Plummer's disease
		- Multinodular goitre
    - Thyroiditis
        - acute infectious → painful goitre
        - subacute → painful goitre
        - autoimmune and post-partum → painless goitre
        - iatrogenic
    - Hashitoxicosis
		- Painless goitre
    - HCG-secretion syndromes
    - Secondary hyperthyroidism → macroadenoma or T3-R mutation
