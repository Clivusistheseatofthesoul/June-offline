## Clinical features:
### Isolated [[Right heart failure]] Sx -> because the right heart is frail and breaks easily from high pulmonary pressure 
### O/E
#### SVC congestion -> [[Elevated JVP]]
#### Primary findings of pulmonary HTN -> [[Loud S2]]
#### IVC congestion -> [[Ascending pitting oedema]], [[Sacral oedema]], [[Hepatosplenomegaly]]

### typically incidental finding on CXR
#### Dilated pulmonary arteries
## DDx: Work from LHS heart to RHS heart
### Pulmonary venous hypertension -> [[Left heart failure]] from systolic or diastolic means
### 2 diseases of the lung cause pulmonary HTN
#### Fluffy lung of [[COPD]] causing hypoxia induced global vasoconstriction
#### Fibrotic lung of [[Interstitial lung disease|ILD]] -> fibrosis of septa
### [[Obstructive sleep apnoea|OSA]] can also scar up the lung
### Pulmonary arterial lesions -> I.e pulmonary emboli -> [[CTEPH]]
### If all ruled out -> [[Primary pulmonary hypertension]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup: work from left to right
### Echo heart
#### PAP > 50 means you should search for pulmonary HTN
### Start looking for causes of pulmonary HTN
#### 2D echo heart to ID venous hypertension from left heart failure
#### PFTs to find COPD
#### HR-CT thorax to find ILD
#### Sleep study for OSA
#### CT-PA or V/Q scan for CTEPH
#### If all -ve -> primary pulmonary hypertension (extremely rare)
### Right heart catherisation with vasodilator challenge 
#### If they respond -> treat with [[vascular specific CCBs]]
#### If they do not respond (most of the time because the pulmonary circuit is fibrotic) -> resort to experimental medications
