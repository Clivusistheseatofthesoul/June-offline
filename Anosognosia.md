# Visuospatial neglect + denial of hemiplegia despite overwhelming evidence for paralysis
## Part of:
### [[Anton-Babinski syndrome]], [[Asomatognosia]], [[Somatoparaphrenia]]

---
Mechanism: Network disorder associated with destructive lesion to the #non-dominant dominant #posterior_insula → inability to generate sense of body ownership, perceived agency and multisensory representations of body states + posterior hippocampal diaschisis secondary to remote infarct resulting in memory 'impairment'
- vascular supply by: #ICA → #MCA (M1) → MCA-M2/3 (posterior trunk) 
Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia

The classical form of anosognosia, Anosognosia for hemiplegia, is a transient disorder which occurs during acute phase of stroke where the patient outright denies prescence of paralysis and behaves contingently with the perception that that the paralysed left hand side of the body is in fact ***perfectly mobile***.

- Although seen alone, anosognosia is often seen in conjunction with other higher order neuropsychiatric features like:
    - visuospatial neglect
    - dressing apraxia
    - disturbed sense of limb ownership
    - deficit in generation and adjustment of belief
    - memory dysfunction
- **It is only seen in non-dominant hemisphere strokes**
