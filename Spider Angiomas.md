# Spiderweb like [[Talengiectasia]] in the distribution of the SVC -> which blanch on compression
## Description:
### Consisting of a central arteriole with thread-like vessels (said to resemble a spiderâ€™s legs) radiating outwards
### Needs at least 3-4 to qualify as a sign of underlying pathology
## DDx:
### [[Chronic liver disease]]

---
Mechanism: Reduced liver function -> inability to meetabolise steroid hormones
- Increased oestrogen coming out of the live -> arteriole dilatation
- Increased Substance P -> systemic neovascularisation -> producing the little 'legs' of the spider
