## Mimics:
### Intracranial aneurysm rupture -> SAH
### Primary angiitis of the CNS 
## Workup:
### Clinical pretest probability through RCVS2 score
#### Recurrent or single thunderclap episode
#### Intracranial carotid narrowing is predictive against RCVS
##### Dissection excludes CNS angiitis -> points towards RCS
#### Vasoconstrictive trigger
#### Sex -> female 
#### SAH 
### On MRI-B imaging 
#### Multifocal cerebral artery narrowing -> with reversibility on the MRI-B 12 weeks later
#### 30-50% have subarachnoid blood on initial head CT
##### Typically cortical blood -> very atypical of aneurysm rupture blood pattern
### LP puncture
#### Complete normal CSF
