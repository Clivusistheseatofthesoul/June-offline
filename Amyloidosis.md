Aliases: Systemic amyloidosis

# Systemic extracellular deposition and infiltration of amyloid protein fibrils
## Clinical features:
### [[Pinch purpura]] at eyelids with [[Macroglossia]]
#### Periorbital purpuric macules accumulate into waxy papules -> nodules can haemorrhage and fill with violaceous substance when pinched or eyes rubbed
#### Sometimes the haemorrhage can be so severe that it presents as [[Raccoon eyes]] immediately after rubbing them
### Other cutaneous manifestations: lichenoid, nodular, macular deposition patterns
### Infiltration of various end-organs:
#### Peripheral nerves -> [[Mononeuritis multiplex]] -> specifically bilateral [[Carpal tunnel syndrome]]
#### Heart -> [[Diastolic heart failure]]
#### Kidney -> [[Proteinuria]] -> [[Nephrotic syndrome]], [[Diabetes insipidus]]
## DDx: Hereditary and acquired causes
### Hereditary amyloidosis
### Acquired light chain (AL) amyloidosis -> #Neoplasm 
#### secondary as paraneoplastic syndrome from [[Plasma cell dyscrasias]]
### Reactive (AA) amyloidosis -> chronic inflammatory state
#### [[RA]], [[Connective tissue diseases]], [[Vasculitis]], [[IBD]]
