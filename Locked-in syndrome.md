# Paralysis of all movements except: vertical gave and eyelid opening i.e Quadriplegia + bilateral facial weakness + bilateral tongue weakness + lateral gaze weakness
## Includes:
### [[Quadriplegia]]
### [[UMN facial weakness]] + bilateral [[tongue weakness]] + [[lateral gaze paresis]]
### Canno't feel anything but pain and temperature -> Complete sensory loss in discrimnatory touch
### Can only lift eye lid

---
Mechanism: Infarction of the ventral pons resulting in cutting off of all motor output to body, facial nucleus, hypoglossal, PPRF (lateral gaze)
- vascularised by: #bilateral #paramedian_branches_of_basilar_artery in the #ventral_pons -> clot need to be exactly here! (typically mid-basilar in location)
Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia

Infarction of the ventral pons results in disruption of all motor output from the body except vertical gaze (dorsal pons) and eyeblinks from the upper eye lid

- All pain and temperature sensation is maintained (dorsal, lateral pons) -> but loss of dorsal column-medial leminscus tracts
- They have CN I,II,III spared -> they can smell, see and partially eyeblink -> that is usually it
- Consciousness is spared (reticular formation)
