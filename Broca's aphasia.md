# Sudden reduction in speech fluency with spared comprehension and semantic representation
## Includes
### Lesions in this area typically cause deficits in action naming that are more severe than deficits in object naming
### Mildly non-fluent forms
####  (1) [[Agrammatisim]]
####  (2) 'Verbal apraxia' -> [[World finding pauses]] where:
##### 'Scrabble-style' -> trial and error with repeated self-correction 
##### abnormal rhythm, stress, and intonation
##### Difficulty initiating speech 
####  (3) preserved comprehension -> Patients are aware of their problem and struggle to try and correct their misarticulation by trial-and-error to no avail
### Severely non-fluent forms 
####  (1) [[Agrammatisim]] -> mumbling and forced sounds which contain emotional inflections but limited often to 'yes' or 'no'
##### Oftentimes preserved singing, emotional and automatic speech
####  (2) 'Verbal apraxia' -> vocabulary itself often limited to 'yes' and 'no' which are used appropriate 
##### 'Scrabble-style' -> trial and error with repeated self-correction to no availb and inevitable fustration
##### abnormal rhythm, stress, and intonation -> sounds like they are learning the language for the first time
##### Difficulty initiating speech 
####  (3) preserved comprehension -> They are often fustrated and upset out of their minds, that the words coming out of their mouth do not match the words they have in their head

### [[Aphasias]]

Mechanism: Destructive lesion to the #dominant hemisphere brodmann areas 44,45 forming #IFG-pars_triangularis + #IFG-pars_opercularis → comprising the functional region: #Brocas_area 
- information from dorsal and ventral auditory streams fail to reach intact premotor language centres → faulty language production
- vascularised by #ICA -> #MCA -M1 -> superior divisions of MCA
Seen in: #Neuro #Ischaemia

Acute onset of any aphasia is considered a sign of stroke until proven othewise.

- Brocas aphasia is primary loss of vocal expressive language with secondary loss to other forms of langauge → writing, symbolic drawing etc
    - NB: In deaf patients, they are **unable to sign** and use manual language. The decline in syntactic accuracy of their sign is often 'analygous' to the paraphasic errors seen in spoken language aphasia.
