## Clinical features:
### Used to be screen -> now no longer
### Elderly men without LUTS! But with rectal Sx or those of metastatic disease
### Large firm, irregular and nodular, fixed hard prostate on DRE
## DDx:
###
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Pathological diagnosis with transrectal Bx, NOT a PSA level
#### PSA should still be obtained at time of dx -> not to diagnose but to establish baseline level 
---
# Tx
## Resection if limited disease staging
## Chemical or surgical castration in metastatic disease
# Moniter
## Track serial PSAs
### See improvement with treatment and identify relapse
---
## Complications
###

---
## Aetiology
### Originates in the peripheral zone cells which are most metabolically active producing PSA -> malignant transformation -> typically indolent disease
#### Guys more often die with prostate cancer, only very rare die from prostate cancer -> lead time bias if you screen for it -> just increasing morbidity burden
## Pathophysiology
### Hypertrophy away from urethra -> lack of LUTS

#### Cases

#disease 
Prostate cancer is less likely to cause obstructive voiding symptoms compared to BPH as it originates mostly in the posterior peripheral zone compared to the central zone
