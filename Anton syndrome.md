# Neglect of cortical blindness with adamant confabulation despite clear evidence of blindness
## Includes:
### [[Cortical blindness]]


---
Mechanism: Destructive lesion to the pathways connecting the conscious visual image forming pathways to the language centres in the dominant angular gyrus
- Lesion to both #bilateral #V1 **and** #dorsal_visual_stream structures
- vascularised by distal branches of the #PCA -> as it requires complete visual sensorium deprivation -> #bilateral infarct

Seen in: #Neuro, #Ischaemia, #Haemorrhage

## Cases
 

A 56-year-old man was referred for impaired vision and clum- siness which had come on suddenly about 6 weeks earlier. He was shown into the room by a nurse, walked forwards towards the consultant's voice and fell over the patient's chair, apologizing profusely for his clumsiness. He continued to look straight ahead, by which time the consultant had moved round to his side to assist him and he only looked in the new direction when spoken to. This alerted suspicion and a hand waved in front of the patient's face was totally ignored. When asked if he could see anything, he said that there was a person in front of him and when asked if he could see the hand in front of his face, he confirmed that he could do so, even though no hand was offered. He continued to behave throughout the interview and examination as if he could see, and would only concede that his vision was 'blurred' in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. There were no other abnormal physical findings. The lesion was presumed to be vascular. The patient was seen in the days before CT scanning was available to confirm the diagnosis.
