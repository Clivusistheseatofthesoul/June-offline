# 
## Clinical features:
###  Presents with progressive [[Cerebellar ataxia]] -> [[Spastic paraparesis|Spastic paraplegia]]
#### There are distinct phenotype variants:
##### PSP like variant -> [[dysarthria]], [[Vertical gaze palsy]] and [[Parkinsonism]]
##### Posterior horn variant -> 
### All eventually show rapidly progressive dementia (although less so than CJD)
#### [[Bradyphrenia]], [[Apraxias]]
### Onset seen in middle age adults with FHx of a similar condition
#### Course is relatively benign and lasts 5-11 years

## DDx:
### Inherited dominant *PRNP* gene allele
## Mimics:
### CJD
![[Sporadic CJD#There are subtle differences in presentation between the CJDs]]

### Inherited dominant missense allele -> Pro102Leu on *PRNP* locus (20p13) -> leading to GOF mutation and accumulation of toxic PRNP
