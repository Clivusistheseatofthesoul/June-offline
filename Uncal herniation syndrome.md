# Constellation of signs associated with movement of the uncus through and underneath the tentorium cerebelli 
## Includes: 3rd nerve palsy + PCA infarct 
### Ipsilateral [[Unilateral blown pupil]] (in the context of mass lesions -> called Hutchinson's pupil) -> may or may not progres to full [[Oculomotor palsy|3rd nerve palsy]]
### Countralateral [[Homonymous hemianopia w macular sparing]], hemianopic [[Cortical blindness]]
### Compression of the ipsilateral or contralateral cerebral peduncle -> [[Kernohan's phenomenon]]
### Pressure necrosis of the para-hippocampal gyrus -> chronic memory deficits
## Part of:
### [[Raised ICP]]

Uncal herniation can proceed towards a [[Central herniation syndrome]] if the mass lesion is diffuse enough -> causing thalamic descention down into the midbrain
