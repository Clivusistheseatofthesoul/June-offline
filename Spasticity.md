# Velocity dependent hypertonia -> which will catch then let go again after further force applied 
## Includes:
### [[Tetanus]]
## Part of:
### [[UMN signs]]


---
Mechanism: destructive lesion to the #UMN in the #corticospinal_tract -> loss of supraspinal control of tone in muscles results in elevated baseline tone (spasticity) but also reflexive activation of the golgi tendon reflex upon application of a 'heavy load' → releasing tension in the spastic muscle group when pushed against during the tone exam -> further stretch of muscle activates muscle stretch reflexes again 
- #M1 -> #posterior_limb_of_internal_capsule -> #cerebral_peduncle -> #medullary_pyramid -> #pyramidal_decussation -> #corticospinal_tract in #lateral_funiculus

Spastic paresis is the cardinal feature of a destructive UMN lesion
- weakness must be present as a prerequisite
- Spasticity is only triggered by faster movement of the limb
- The spasticity is dependent on the muscle → anti-gravity muscles have biased preference for spasticity → Upper limb flexors + Lower limb extensors have relative hypertonia to their antagonistic counterparts -> foundation of [[Pyramidal stance]]
