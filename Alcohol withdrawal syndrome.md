# Alcohol withdrawal in someone who is dependent on alcohol results in set clinical phases comprising alcohol withdrawral syndrome
## Clinical features:
### In the following order: [[Minor syndrome]] -> [[Alcoholic hallucinosis]] and [[Withdrawal seizures]] occur earlier -> [[Delirium tremens]] appears last
#### Severity is determined by:
##### Past severe episodes, past withdrawal seizures, requirement of eye-opener drink, increased alcohol consumption
### The most important features to watch for are:
#### Derangement of vitals -> esp. [[diastolic hypertension]]
#### [[Altered mental status]] with [[Hyperactive delirium]] -> predicts onset of [[Delirium tremens]]
#### [[Seizures]]
## DDx:
### Strongly suggestive of chronic [[Alcohol use disorder]] when they are not able to drink
#### Typically this occurs due to admission not related to alcoholism -> and on the 3rd day of admission they start seizing

## Mimics:
### Chronic [[Benzos]] use can produce the same exact syndrome
## Workup:
### Alcohol withdrawal scale
### In early phase -> with seizures -> alcohol could still be in blood
#### Serum BAC

# Tx
## Supplement before refeeding 
### Give thiamine (IV) 100 mg tds for brain protection
#### For at least 3 days before switch to PO 
## Maintain stability
### Prevent dehydration → oral fluids → IV if severe
## Sympatomatic relief
### PO or IV [[Diazepam]] to sedate first line without resp depression
### Seizures -> IV Midazolam for fast acting 
### Haloperidol if hallucinations don't go away
## Other symptoms:
### headache -> ?paracetamol
### N/V -> [[Ondansetron]]
### Diarrhoea -> Loperamide
### Reflux -> PPI
## Long acting Benzodiazepene taper
### Front load or symptom triggered diazepam 
#### Front load with PO or IV diazepam 
#### Symptom triggered 

# Tx to prevent relapse
## See [[Alcohol use disorder]]

## Complications
### Upon recovery from delirium tremens -> typically only residual exhaustion but sometimes can have permenant [[Retrograde amnesia|Retrograde amnesic syndrome]]

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### Chronic alcohol exposure -> reduced GABAa + increased NMDA expression
