![Volkmann Ischemic Contracture](https://boneandspine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/volkmann-ischemic-contracture.jpg)
Volkmann's contracture is graded by severity:
1.  **MILD:** Flexion contracture of 2 or 3 fingers with no or limited loss of sensation
2.  **MODERATE:** All fingers are flexed and the thumb is oriented in the palmar orientation. The fist, in this case, can remain permanently flexed and there is usually a loss of sensation in the hand.
3.  **SERIOUS:** All muscles in the forearm (flexors and extensors) are involved. This is a serious limiting condition.
