## Everyone who smokes currently should be advised to quit
### 'The best thing you can do for your health is to quit smoking’
### Quitting itself is a process not an event, most will take a few tries, but with each try we get better at it
## Everyone with suspicion of nicotine dependence gets brief cessation advice
### The type and degree of brief intervention depends on the stage of change

| Contraindications | Children < 12 years, hypersensitivity to patch/gum/ lozenge/menthol                   | Contra-indicated in preganancy, Reports of mood changes and suicidal ideations in those with mental health disorders, can cause nausea | C.I in those with PMHx seizures, MAOi use, pregnancy                     | 
### You can combined NRT patches with veranicline for even greater effect
## Behavioral intervention
### Trigger management
#### Most common triggers are: stress, seeing another person smoke, particular place/being the car when driving
##### Avoid 
- Avoid the trigger altogether
##### Distance
- chuck the cigarettes into the boot so you can't see them
- if living with someone who smokes, ask them to smoke outside and not with you
##### Replace
- have the spray on your bedside drawer, keep the cigarettes as far away as possible (if in the bin they are to be in the bin outside not in the house)
- when on the phone pick something else up instead E.g a pen -> get into pen spinning

## Aetiology
### Nicotine is a nicotinic α4β2 receptor AchR agonist in VTA neurons -> triggering release of dopamine across the MFB
![Nicotine addiction flow chart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928221/bin/nihms227888f1.jpg)
### Those with certain genetic alleles have increased risk of dependence
#### α5/α3/β4 nicotinic cholinergic receptor gene complex (15q25)
## Pathophysiology
### Nicotine is the component responsible for addiction
![Components of addiction in nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928221/bin/nihms227888f3.jpg)
The first smoke of the day is most often the most satisfying due to the prolonged withdrawal through the night
- As you progress in the day you're reminded to smoke with minor withdrawals but the hedonic effects get less and less unless you smoke more and more

### Tobacco smoke itself that contains all of the carcinogenic compounds
