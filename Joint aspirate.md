| WBC count  | <200   | 2000   | 2000 < n < 50,000 | >50,000 is the overriding dx            |

| Gram stain | -      | -      | -                 | +ve if staph, grow if -ve for gonnorhea |
| Crystals   | -      | -      | +/-               | -                                       |

If the patient has crystals -> we still culture the fluid because inflammatory and septic pictures overlap
- the crystalline arthropathy occuring simultaneously with a infection will hide the septic arthropathy
