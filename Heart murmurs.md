## Occurs with pulse -> [[Systolic murmur]]
## Occurs between pulse -> [[Diastolic murmur]]
### If complex -> either [[Patent ductus arteriosus|PDA]] or they have both a systolic and diastolic murmur!
# Determine character of murmur
## If [[Systolic murmur]]
### Is it uniform -> [[Uniform murmur|Pan]]-systolic murmur
### Or does it come up then down (it go 'whub') -> [[Crescendo-decrescendo murmur]]
## If [[Diastolic murmur]]
### If you just guess -> guess [[Chronic aortic regurgitation]]
### is it uniform +/- getting lower towards the end -> Uniform murmur with pre-systolic accentuation 
### Is it a blowing? -> [[Decrescendo murmur]]
# Find the answer
## If [[Systolic murmur]]
### and uniform -> [[Uniform murmur|Pan]]-systolic murmur
#### Loud murmur -> [[Ventricular septal defect|VSD]]
#### Softer murmur which can get louder by fist clenching -> [[Mitral regurgitation]]
### and it come up then down (it go 'whub') -> [[Crescendo-decrescendo murmur]]
#### S2 obscured -> [[Aortic stenosis]]
#### whub finishes early and you can still hear S2 -> [[Flow murmur]]
## If [[Diastolic murmur]]
### and it uniform +/- getting lower towards the end -> Uniform murmur with pre-systolic accentuation 
#### [[Mitral stenosis]]
### and it blowing? -> [[Decrescendo murmur]]
#### [[Chronic aortic regurgitation]]
