# Tx
## Psychotherapy is far superior to medications
### You teach the person to deal with their anxiety
## Chronic [[SSRI]] or [[SNRI]] are used to improve mood
## Acute panic attacks are managed differently and may involve benzos
### DO NOT PRESCRIBE benzos chronically to patients with GAD -> they will become dependent on them
