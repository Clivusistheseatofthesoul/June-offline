# Acute onset hypersensitivity reaction involving desquamation of both epidermis and mucosal surfaces
## Clinical features:
### [[Skin desquamation]] and [[Mucosal desquamation]] occuring weeks after starting a drug 
#### Initially just a coryzal illness Â± [[Allergic conjunctivitis]]
#### Macules rapidly spread and coalesce, leading to epidermal blistering, necrosis, and sloughing
#### Skin that will fall off if you as much as roll your finger across it
### Oftentimes with [[Conjunctivitis]]
## DDx:
### S-J syndrome is almost always due to a drug reaction
#### Sulfa drugs -> [[Sulfonamide]]
#### Certain antibiotics -> [[Penicillins]] 
#### Anti epileptics -> [[Lamotrigine]], [[Carbamezapine]]
#### Misc -> [[Allopurinol]]
### Certain infections can also do it:
#### [[M. pneumoniae]]
## Mimics:
### Toxic shock syndrome
### Exfoliative Erythroderma
### Autoimmune and paraneoplastic pemphigus
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis

# Tx

## Complications

### [[Acute DIC]] and Pancytopaenia

S-J syndrome is technically < 10% skin surface desquamated while TEN is when > 30% of the skin surface is desquamated
- S-J/TEN overlap syndrome is when there is between 10-30% overlap
