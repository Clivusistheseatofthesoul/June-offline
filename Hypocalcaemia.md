# Syndrome of not enough [Ca2+] in the blood
## Clinical features:
### [[Perioral paresthesia]], [[Muscle cramp]] -> attacks of [[Tetany]]
### [[Proximal muscle weakness]]
### [[Trousseau's sign]] and [[Chvostek's sign]]
## DDx:
### [[Hypoparathyroidism]]
### [[PTH resistance]]
### [[Vitamin D deficiency]]
### [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]]
### Excessive deposition
#### [[Paget's disease]], [[Chronic pancreatitis]]

## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Clinical suggestion -> check the labs
### Labs
#### When the albumin is deficient
##### Ca2+ is normally bound to albumin so will be falsely low and not a true measure of ionised calcilum 
	For every 1 unit albumin < 4 add 0.8 to the serum [Ca2+] value
##### If the Ca2+ corrects -> its not hypocalcaemia
#### Ionised Ca2+ will be low

---
# Tx
## IV Ca gluconate. thats it.
## Additional therapy depending on aetiology
### If CKD -> Ca + vitamin D replacement + Cinecalcet

---
## Complications
### Chronic hypocalcaemia -> Early onset [[Cataracts]]

---
## Aetiology
### Physiological control of serum [Ca2+]
#### PTH controls blood Ca2+
##### Cells with packaged PTH hormone
- Calcium sensitive proteins which prevent exocytosis
- Rise in serum Ca2+ -> calcium senstive protein activated -> reduced PTH secretion
- Decrease in serum Ca2+ -> calcium sensitive protein inhibited -> increased PTH secretion

##### PTH acts on 3 organs:
1. Directly on bone -> increased bone resorption -> elevation in serum Ca2+ and PO4+
2. **directly on kidney** -> if the kidneys are working the **kidney always wins**
	- Retention of Ca2+ 
	- excretion fo PO4+
	- increases 1-25OH vitamin D -> acts on gut to:
		- increase Ca2+ absorption
		- increased PO4+ absorption
3. indirectly on GI
	- Increases 1-25OH vitamin D -> acts on gut to:
		- increase Ca2+ absorption
		- increased PO4+ absorption
