Aliases: Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation
---
# Sudden exposure to procoagulants -> causing generalised clotting of blood
## Clinical features: Result from overwhelming uptake of coagulant factors -> bleeding 
### Generalised [[Ecchymoses]] which may involve the mucous membranes -> bleeding into the lips and genitals
### Internal haemorrhage -> [[GI bleeding]], [[Haemothorax]], haemoperitoneum
### Acute constitutional features -> [[Fever]], malaise
## DDx:
### Acute infections
#### Generation of endo/exotoxins -> [[Sepsis]]
#### [[Snake bites]]
#### Acute global MSK and skin injury -> [[Burns]], [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
#### Obstetric complication -> [[Pre-eclampsia]] and [[Eclampsia]], Placental abruption
## Mimics:

## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis
---
# Tx
## Currently bleeding -> replenish coagulation factors
### FFP transfusion in those unstable
### If very severe -> transfusion of IV recombinant factor VII
## Not-currently bleeding -> active monitering, regular obs

---
## Complications
### If recovered through homeostasis -> chronic compensation by generation of extra procoagulant molecules -> [[Chronic DIC]]
