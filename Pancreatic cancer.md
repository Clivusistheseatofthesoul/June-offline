## Clinical features:
### Sometimes present as epigastric pain -> like chronic pancreatitis
### But oftentimes is completely asymptomatic -> [[Painless Jaundice]], [[Trousseau's syndrome|Migratory thromboplebitis]]
#### Accompanied by [[Reduced appetite]] and [[Unintentional weight loss]]
### New onset of worsening [[T1DM]]
### Sometimes can feel a RUQ mass 
## DDx:
### Cystic lesions
#### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) -> i.e duct cancer -> mucin can block duct forming a cyst 
#### Serous cystadenoma (benign lesion) -> can be due to [[Von Hippel-Lindau disease]]
### Solid lesions
#### Adenocarcinoma
#### Neuroendocrine tumor -> can be due to [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I]]
##### Can be non-functioning or functioning -> [[insulinoma]], [[Gastrinoma]], [[VIPoma]], [[Glucagonoma]]
## Mimics:
### Focal autoimmune pancreatitis can present with similar imaging 
### Cholangiocarcinoma
## Workup: Follow [[Painless Jaundice]] workup with additional 
### Labs
#### LFTs
#### Tumor markers -> Ca 19.9, CEA, Chromogranin A 
##### CEA -> Adenocarcinoma
##### CHromogranin A -> neuroendocrine tumor
#### IgG4 -> sensitive for autoimmune pancreatitis

### Imaging
#### US
##### Biliary dilatation and pancreatic head mass
#### High resolution CT abdo -> segreates between solid and cystic lesion
##### Double duct sign -> dilation of both bile and pancreatic ducts
#### If still unsure -> endoscopic US with Bx
##### Can aspirate fluid for analysis

# Surgical Tx -> typically [[Whipples operation]] oftentimes with neoadjuvant chemo
## Simple cysts, pseudocysts and cystadenomas are not resected
### Sometimes if very symptomatic or very large the pseudocyst can be drained
## IPMN may be resected if high risk
### High risk IPMN
#### Involve the main duct, or are symptomatic side duct lesion
#### Are very large > 3cm
### Low risk side branch IPMN is by far the most common 
## Adenocarcinoma has poor long term survival even in those that are resected
### Most have metastasised before detection
# Chemo
## Palliative chemotherapy
### Octeotride labelled chemo for neuroendocrine tumors
# Sx Mx
## Relieve cholestasis
### ERCP with metallic stent
## Neuropathic pain
### Coeliac plexus invasion -> relieve with coeliac plexus block
