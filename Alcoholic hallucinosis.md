The patient may be discovered arguing angrily with his voices, or he may complain to the police about them.
- Sometimes the voices command the patient to do things against his will
- Their compelling quality may be such that he is driven to a suicide attempt or some episode of bizarre behaviour
- Usually the voices address the patient directly, but sometimes they converse with one another about him, referring to him in the third person as in schizophrenia
	- Secondary delusional interpretations follow upon the hallucinatory experiences, and the patient comes to believe firmly that he is watched, hounded or in danger
	- Consequently, alcoholic hallucinosis superficially resembles acute paranoid schizophrenia
	- However, the delusions will be found to follow only the hallucinatory experiences and not to arise autochthonously
	- Schizophrenic thought disorder is not seen, nor incongruity of affect, and insight is regained immediately the voices begin to wane.
