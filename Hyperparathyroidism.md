# Too much PTH
## Clinical features:
### Present with syndrome of [[Hypercalcaemia]]
### Increased bone turnover -> pathologic fractures -> [[Lumbar crush fracture]], [[NOF fracture]]
## DDx:
### Primary 
#### Autonomous adenoma
#### Drug induced resistance to serum [Ca2+]
##### [[Lithium]]
### Secondary
#### Physiologic response to hypocalcaemia in early [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]]
### Tertiary
#### chronic secondary elevated PTH (chronic hypocalcaemia) -> Autonomous multiple adenoma from 
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Elevated serum PTH
#### Effects of PTH -> elevated Ca2+ and reduced PO4+
#### **Vitamin D is not required**
### To determine aetiology -> imaging
#### Sesame scan

## Aetiology
### Physiology of PTH
Cells with packaged PTH hormone
- Calcium sensitive proteins which prevent exocytosis
- Rise in serum Ca2+ -> calcium senstive protein activated -> reduced PTH secretion
- Decrease in serum Ca2+ -> calcium sensitive protein inhibited -> increased PTH secretion

PTH acts on 3 organs:
1. Directly on bone -> increased bone resorption -> elevation in serum Ca2+ and PO4+
2. **directly on kidney** -> if the kidneys are working the **kidney always wins**
	- Retention of Ca2+ 
	- excretion fo PO4+
	- increases 1-25OH vitamin D -> acts on gut to:
		- increase Ca2+ absorption
		- increased PO4+ absorption
3. indirectly on GI
	- Increases 1-25OH vitamin D -> acts on gut to:
		- increase Ca2+ absorption
		- increased PO4+ absorption
