# Onset of puberty (development of secondary sexual characteristics) above 13 in females (or no menarchy by 16) and 14 in males: tanner stages happen later than normal in completely normal sequence
## Includes:
### For females, [[Primary amenorrhea]] or [[Delayed breast development]]
### For males, [[Delayed testicular growth]]
### [[short-stature]] relative to peers is more general and unreliable
## Part of:
### [[Primary gonadal failure]], [[Secondary gonadal failure]]

## DDx: These require labs in order to differentiate 
### High FSH/LH -> suggestive of intrinsic gonadal dysfunction
#### In both sexes -> Past [[Radiotherapy to pelvis]] or [[Chemotherapy]], or other rare genetic disorders E.g [[Noonan's syndrome]]
#### In females -> [[Turner's syndrome]]
#### In males -> [[Klinefelter's syndrome]]
### Low FSH/LH -> suggestive of central hypothalamic/pituitary mediated failure of pubertal induction
#### Functional -> [[Benign constitutional delay in puberty and growth]]
#### Permenant (unless aetiology is removed)
##### Congenital causes -> [[Kallman's syndrome]], [[Prader-willi syndrome]] 
##### Acquired causes -> Sellar mass, CNS infiltrative disease affecting the hypothalamus, PMHx of CNS trauma or infection to the sellar region

Mechanism: Prerequisite signalling not met for activation of innate puberty induction system -> KISS1 mRNA production in KNDy neurons of arcuate nucleus -> instantiation of the HPG axis

From the hormone panel, it is impossible to discriminate between a secondary or tertiary gonadal failure due to inability to measure GnRH.

- most of the time it is just delayed either familially → be sure to ask for a FHx; or delayed due to some environmental reason → [benign constitutional delay in puberty and growth](../../Pathophysiology%20index%20ece86e8b0c044eada17e958a6ec5984e/Pathophysiology%20index%20by%20type%20ad8b6274d9c54c9a90bf17eb311f049f/benign%20constitutional%20delay%20in%20puberty%20and%20growth%2088e09c2e187746e983657237cc204f97.md)
    - high levels of physical activity → low body fat → delayed puberty due to low leptin signaling the abscence of enough cholesterol for steroidogenesis (and for females, a pregnancy and breastfeeding)

Pathological causes of delayed puberty are classified into:
1. Primary gonadal failure (hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism)
	- Females -> Turner's syndrome
	- Males -> Klinefelter's syndrome
	- Both sexes: 
		- Chemotherapy or radiotherapy 
		- other rare genetic disorder E.g [[Noonan's syndrome]]
2. Secondary gonadal failure or tertiary gonadal failure (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism) aka central gondal failure
        - Divided into functional and permenant causes of central failure:
            - Functional: aka [[Benign constitutional delay in puberty and growth]]
                - Chronic stress
                - Low body fat (think ballet dancers)
                - Chronic illness
            - Permenant:
                - Genetic causes
                    - Kallmann syndrome
                    - [[Prader-willi syndrome]]
                - Acquired causes
                    - Sellar mass
                    - Infiltrative disease of basal brain 
                    - past CNS trauma or SurgHx
