# Constellation of features associated with critical elevation in pressure within any fascial compartment. Most commonly in the leg or thigh
## Includes:
### Excruciating extremity [[Pain out of proportion]] to injury
### Late signs -> [[Paresthesia]], [[Delayed capillary refill]], [[Pallor]], Peripheral [[Mononeuropathy]]

## DDx:
### Most commonly secondary to -> [[Fracture]]
### Then Haemorrhage and [[DVT]]
## Ix:
### Labs
#### Elevated CK which is prolonged and stays high in the thousands

---
**Mechansim:** rise in pressure within fascial compartment -> arterial insufficiency   -> ischaemic damage -> Ischemic muscle and tissue become hypoxic and generate acidosis with secondary increased capillary permeability -> further fluid extravasation into compartment further increases pressure -> Distal nerve and muscle become ischemic and necrose

**Seen in:** Infection, Skeletal muscle, Trauma, haemorrhage
Sign: 


There are the 5Ps of compartment syndrome as it is really important to recognise this to prevent someone from losing a leg/arm.

- P

    **Pain out of proportion of injury**

- P

    **Pain out of proportion of injury** - they are screaming and you don't know why

- P

    **Pain out of proportion of injury** - you better do something quick

- P

    **Pain out of proportion of injury** - you gonna get sued at this point

- P

    **Pain out of proportion of injury** - they've lost that limb.

Here are the actual 5Ps → although if your past the 1st one → it is probably too late

1. **Pain out of proportion to injury**
2. Paraesthesia
3. Pulselessness and lack of capillary refill
4. Pallor → looks pale
5. Paralysis → can't move
