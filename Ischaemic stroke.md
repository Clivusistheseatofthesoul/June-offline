# [[Cerebrovascular disease|Ischaemic infarction of CNS tissue]] due to hypoperfusion of CNS parenchyma
## Clinical features:
### Some focal neurologic deficit fitting a [[Vascular syndrome]]
## DDx: Occlusive and Non-Occlussive
### Occlusive aetiology
#### Intrinsic stenosis -> [[Atherosclerosis]], [[Lipohyalinosis]], [[Carotid dissection]]
#### Cardioembolic source -> Structural or electrical
##### Arrhythmias -> [[AFib]] or [[Acute AFib]]
##### Structural heart disease -> [[Myocardial infarction]], [[Congenital heart diseases]], [[Valvular heart diseases]] esp. [[Prosthetic valves]] and associated [[Endocarditis]] esp. [[Infective endocarditis]]
##### Carotid artery disease -> [[Carotid artery stenosis]]
#### Cryptogenic occlusion -> must search in young patient (Age  < 50 y/o)
##### [[DVT]] through a PFO or Pulmonary AV malformation 
##### Diseases causing [[Hypercoagulable states]] -> [[Trousseau's syndrome]], [[Genetic thrombophillias]] [[Anti-phospholipid syndrome]]
##### Non-atheromatous [[Vasculopathy]] -> esp. Large vessel [[Vasculitis]]
For young patients -> [[Moya-moya disease]], [[Behcet's]]
For elderly patients -> [[GCA|Giant cell arteritis]]
##### Autoimmune thrombosis -> [[SLE]]
### Non occlusive aetiology
#### Any type of [[Shock]] -> [[Watershed infarct]]

## Mimics:
### [[TIA]], Haemorrhagic stroke, Seizure with post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis, Migraine with aura
## Workup: See [[Suspected stroke]]
### Clinical syndrome needs to be confirmed with imaging
---
# Tx: see [[Suspected stroke]]

---
## Complications
### Haemorrhagic transformation -> increased risk after thrombolysis/thrombectomy -> [[Intraparenchymal haemorrhage]]
