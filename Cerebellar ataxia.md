# Inco-ordination as a result of insult to the cerebellum and associated cerebellar efferents. These are not compensatable by visual cues unless reversible/mild (i.e alcoholic intoxication)
## Includes: Classically only the motor + vestibular cerebellar syndromes but now includes the cognitive cerebellar syndromes as well 
### [[Ataxic Dysarthria]]
### [[Rebound nystagmus]], [[Coarse nystagmus]], [[Multi-directional nystagmus]]
### [[Limb ataxia]] -> [[Intention tremor]], [[Dysmetria]], [[Dysdiadochokinesia]], [[Cerebellar drift]] and unilateral rebound phenomenon 
### [[Gait ataxia]] -> classically with a negative Romberg's test!
### Flocculonodular lobe dysfunction -> [[Central Vertigo]]
### Cerebrocerebellar lobe dysfunction -> [[Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome|Schmahmann's syndrome]]

## DDx:
### [[Alcohol intoxication]] and [[Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration]]
### Cerebral degeneration syndromes
#### rapidly progressive
##### [[Multiple system atrophy]] type C 
##### [[Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration]]
#### Young child/adult -> genetic syndromes
##### Mitochondrial diseases
##### [[CANVAS syndrome]]
## Mimics:
### Alcohol is responsible but can often hide another cause! **Always do a full workup!**

Mechanism: Destructive lesion of the entire cerebellum -> damaging motor loops affecting the #cerebellum/flocculonodular_cerebellum , #cerebellum/spinocerebellum , and #cerebellum/cerebrocerebellum -> resulting in balance, motor output and cognito-affective 'dysmetrias' respectively
Seen in: #Neuro

Cerebellar signs of destructive lesions result in clinical features of impaired coordination and are collectively referred to as cerebellar ataxia.

- Compare this to [Sensory ataxia](Sensory%20ataxia%20af201817677746f09578e5ce6af573cf.md) which is caused by loss of proprioceptive sensory input into the cerebellum â†’ usually destructive lesions to the posterior funiculus.
- Compare this to [Vestibular ataxia](Vestibular%20ataxia%20179aa9f27f2b4eb3ada5086c0a870df8.md) which is caused by destructive lesions to the vestibular pathways
