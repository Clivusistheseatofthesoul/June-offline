# Protrusion of the globe out of the normal sitting position in the orbit -> best seen from above and the side
## Part of:
### [[Graves' orbitopathy]], [[Orbital apex syndrome]]
## DDx:
### If [[Pulsatile proptosis]] with chemosis -> [[Carotid-cavernous fistula]]
### If Proptosis with chemosis and opthlamoplegia -> [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]]

Exopthalmos is technically proptosis in the special case of [[Graves' orbitopathy|Thyroid eye disease]] -> proptosis should be used to refer to protrusion of the globe in any other setting

Because of the expansion in shift in position, the proptosis itself causes several complications:

- Inability to close eyelids → corneal ulceration, dry eyes and conjunctivitis
- Optic disk stretching → optic atrophy and unilateral visual deterioration
