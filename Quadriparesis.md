# Weakness in all 4 limbs
## Includes:
### [[Elsberg phenomenon]]
## DDx: Split into CNS and systemic causes
## UMN quadriparesis -> Most likely [[Myelopathy]]:
### Child -> [[Cerebral palsy]]
### Posturing -> [[Decerebrate]]
### Sudden quadriparesis -> Cervical [[Spinal cord injury]] or [[Primary pontine haemorrhage]]
### with Elsberg phenomenon -> Gradual progression in 'ring-around-the-rosie' pattern (UL->LL-> contralateral LL -> contralateral UL) -> extramedullary compressive lesion from ipsilateral side of cervical cord

## or LMN quadriparesis -> various causes are most common 														
### If abset reflexes -> Acute onset ascending weakness pattern -> [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]]
### **Pure motor** deficit:
#### Diurnal variation -> NMJ pathology -> [[Lambert-Eaton syndrome]] or [[Myasthenia gravis]]
#### (usually) Proximal weakness -> [[Myopathy]]
#### Rarely -> when occuring in conjunction with UMN signs -> late presentation of  [[MND]]
## Systemic causes: 
### Electrolyte disturbance -> [[Hypokalaemia]], [[Hypomagnesaemia]]
### Endocrine -> [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
## Mimics:
### Altered mental status

Mechanism: Destrictive lesion to the spinal cord at high #cervical_segment
