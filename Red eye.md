## History
|                | Episcleritis                                       | Scleritis                                                                                                 | Anterior uveitis                                                          | Acute angle closure glaucoma                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Patient group  | Idiopathic or more rarely autoimmune diseases      | Autoimmune diseases                                                                                       | Autoimmune disease                                                        | FHx,                                                           |
| Pain           | Mild with acute onset                              | Moderate to severe wtih subacute onset -> esp exacerbated by eye movement                                 | Moderate to severe pain                                                   | Moderate to severe                                             |
| Other symptoms | Gritty sensation and ache moreso than pain         | Photophobia, fever and headache                                                                           | Photophobia                                                               | PHotophobia with halos around light                            |
| Visual acuity  | Normal                                             | Normal or decreased                                                                                       | Normal or decreased                                                       | Reduced acuity                                                 |
| Exam           | Area bright red, vessels can be moved and blanched | Affected area may be blueish violet, vessels nonmovable and non-blanchable, can have concurrent keratitis | Cillary flush, Consensual photophobia with constricted or irregular pupil | Cilliary flush, corneal haziness, with mid-dilated fixed pupil | 
### Time course
#### Aburpt vs gradual onset
##### Triggering event -> looking for trauma, occupational history
#### Duration and progression
### Unilateral or bilateral
#### If bilateral -> did they start simultaneously or was one red -> then the other one
### Eye pain
#### Severity of pain most important
### Noticable loss of vision
#### Immediately need to start thinking about [[Acute angle closure glaucoma]]
### Photophobia
### Foreign body sensation?
#### discrete sensation -> Indicative of cornea pathology
#### Just generalise grittyness -> [[Conjunctivitis]]
### Type of discharge
#### Watery, purulent, bloody
### PMHx
#### Hx of eye surgery
#### Immunocompromised
#### Autoimmune diseases
## **DO YOU WEAR CONTACT LENSES?**
## O/E
### Describe the extraocular surroundings
#### Periorbital region
#### Eyelids
### Hyperaemia
#### Pattern
##### Perilimbic sparing vs cilliary flush
##### Discharge and prescence of haemorrhage
#### Hypaema and hypopyon
### Is there a foreign body?
### Pupils
#### Non-responsive pupils automatically warrants an emergent opthal consult
### Visual acuity, fields
#### Reduced acuity automatically warrants an urgent Opthal consult
### EOM
## Bedside
### If glaucoma is suspected -> **DO NOT DILATE THE EYES or use phenylephrine**
### Slit lamp
### Fundoscopic exam typically not neccessary to diagnose red eye conditions
#### Most patients will have photophobia anyways -> making this very uncomfortable
## Labs
### Typically not neccessary unless specific systemic diseases are suspected UNLESS:
#### There is any suspicion for STIs
##### Any suspicion of chlamydia or gonoccocal infection -> STI screen
#### Feel that you need to swab it

## Consults
### These are red-flags warranting opthal consults either urgently or emergently
#### Any suggestion of anterior chamber pathology
##### Hypaema or hypopyon
##### Corneal opacification
##### Non-responsive pupil
#### Any suggestion of stubborn corneal pathology
##### Corneal abrasion which has not healed in 3 days or a large abrasion
##### Foreign body which canno't be removed by irrigation and swab
##### Keratitis or any cilliary flush
#### Any suggestion of potential loss of vision
##### reduced visual acuity
