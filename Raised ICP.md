# Raised ICP is recognisable and should be promptly assessed to prevent death by brainstem herniation
## Includes:
###  [[Raised ICP headache]], [[Cushing's Triad]], [[Altered mental status]]
### Further progression -> [[Sub-falcine herniation syndrome]], [[Uncal herniation syndrome]], [[Foramen magnum herniation syndrome]], [[Abducens palsy]]

## DDx: [[CNS mass lesion]]
### Acute expanding space occupying CNS lesion -> [[Intraparenchymal haemorrhage]], [[Epi-dural haemorrhage]], [[Acute Sub-dural haemorrhage]]
#### Chornically expanding mass lesion -> chronic sub-dural, [[Intracranial neoplasm]], [[Neurocysticercosis]], [[Chronic sub-dural haemorrhage]]
### Progressive cerebral oedema -> Malignant [[Ischaemic stroke]], fulminant [[Herpes simplex encephalitis]], [[Pyogenic meningitis]], [[Anoxic encephalopathy]], [[Lead toxicity]], [[Vitamin A toxicity]]
## [[Obstructive hydrocephalus]]
## More rarely [[Communicating hydrocephalus]]
###
## Young overweight female -> [[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension]]

There are multiple signs of increased ICP which should be recognised early 
- Cushing's reflex is activated late in raised ICP. The initial stage of Cushing's reflex should be actively looked for in suspect raised ICP: [Hypertension](Hypertension%202c98701d6aee411a8595bb5ab2268d99.md), [tachycardia](tachycardia%203aaea9c246e1437296829242b0137d06.md) for prompt intervention.
- As the baroreceptor reflex feedsback → vagus activation of the heart alters the Cushing's reflex in later stages into → [Hypertension](Hypertension%202c98701d6aee411a8595bb5ab2268d99.md) and [Bradycardia](Bradycardia%207a7224bbf3294e59867e56cdc9cac179.md)
- Irregular breathing (sometimes [Cheyne-Stokes breathing ](Cheyne-Stokes%20breathing%20950fde2151c3406c8c390a1be957239c.md) other times Biot's breathing → the difference is academic and not clinically of relevance) is the final sign of initiating herniation.

There are several causes of raised ICP which need to be managed differently:
1. Mass lesion
2. Cerebral oedema:
    - Vasogenic → tumour's and abscesses

        Indicates for use of osmolar agent, mass resection, EVD and VP shunts

    - Ischaemic → post stroke, diffuse axonal injury

        **Do not use steroids**, osmolar agent, shunt

    - Granulocytic → any CNS infection

        Depends on the type of infection

    - interstitial  → obstructive hydrocephalus (see below)

        Treatment is curative surgery.
3. Poor CSF resorption

---
# Acute Tx
## If emergent -> invasive ICP monitering and surgical decompression
## Elevate head to > 30 degrees and reduce stimulation to patient
## IV mannitol and controlled hyperventilation to pCO2 of 25-30mM
### No hypotonic fluids -> if there is concomittant hypernatraemia use enteral free water
### IV 0.5-1g/kg bolus over 10 minutes followed by 0.25-0.5 g/kg q4-6hrly
### Reduces pCO2 -> induce cerebral vasoconstriction -> reduce ICP fast but will cause ischaemia

# Chronic Tx
## IV steroids are useful for vasogenic oedema
### IV 20mg methylprednisolone

# Monitering
## Aim pCO2 25-30
## Aim serum osmolality 310-320
### Do not continue this for > 5 days


-   Decrease stimulation.
