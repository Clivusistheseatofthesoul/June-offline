# Disease of bone remodelling resulting in increased proportions of woven (more elastic) bone 
## Clinical features:
### 80% of patients with radiological or biochemical Paget's are completely asymptomatic
### Earliest Sx is [[Bone pain]] sometimes with [[Erythema]] over bony regions affected
#### Often described as aching and deep and often worse at night
### Bone enlargement -> Skull enlargement with glabellar prominence -> classically presenting as **increasing hat size**
#### Can cause [[Scalp vein sign]] which can be mistaken for prominent ext temporal artery
#### Ankylosis of ossicles + compromise of nerves ->Mixed [[Sensorineural deafness|Sensorineural]] and [[Conductive hearing loss]]
### Fixed [[Thoracic kyphosis]] with [[Chronic back pain]] that is worse at night
### Long bone bending of lower limbs -> [[Saber shins]] and femur bowing 
## DDx:
### Genetic susceptibility + currently unknown environmental factors 
### Pure genetic syndromes
#### [[IBMPFD]]
#### In children -> [[Juvenile paget's disease]]
## Mimics:
### Osteomyelitis!
### Primary bone neoplasms
### Secondary bone neoplasms -> esp.  Fibrogenesis imperfecta ossium which shares the same elevation in ALP
### Osteoporosis
## Workup:
### Elevated ALP with normal LFTs
#### serum 25-OH vitamin D and Ca2+
### Urinalysis for NTx and betaCTx are markers for collagen degradation
### X-Ray affected bones
#### Bone lesions may subsequently become sclerotic and have a mixed lytic and sclerotic appearance
### Bone scan and DEXA scan to rule out concommitant osteoporosis (common)

# Tx
## Adequate analgesia with [[Paracetamol]] Â± [[NSAID]] 
### Supportive physiotherapy and hydrotherapy also important to reduce chronic pain
## First line treatment is [[Bisphosphonates]] with Ca2+ and Vit D supplementation
### IV zoledronic acid 5mg once yearly
#### Vit D deficiency should be corrected prior to first dose
#### Make sure to warn patients about first dose pain!
##### Paradoxical increase in pain with first dose of zoledronic acid -> which will dissappear
### Ca2+ and Vit D are supplemented to prophylactically prevent hypocalcaemia
#### Esp. common in those recieving bisphosphonates and are on [[Loop diuretic]]
## If Bisphosphonate is not tolerated -> [[Calcitonin]]

# Monitering
## Routine monitering and serial ALPs initially -> then annually
### Sudden rise in bone pain with ALP and new lesion on bone scan -> neoplastic transformation

---
## Complications
### [[Hypocalcaemia]] is common
### with lack of activity/Immobilisation precipitates -> [[Osteoporosis]] and [[Nephrolithiasis]]
### Severe multi-bone involvement (Polyostotic disease) -> multiple AV shunts -> [[high-output heart failure]]
### Severe skull involvement
#### Cranial nerve palsies from impingement of the neural foramina
#### formation of arteriovenous shunts within the bone [[Vascular steal syndrome]] of the skull -> [[Excessive daytime sleepiness|Hypersomnia]] + recurrent [[TIA]]
### Severe spin involvement
#### Vertebral collapse and/or vascular steal of the vertebral bodies -> [[Cauda equina syndrome]]	
### Chronic involvement may predispose to neoplastic transformation -> [[Osteosarcoma]] or [[Giant cell tumor]]

## Aetiology
### Viral infection in genetically susceptible individuals
#### Inherited autosomal dominant alleles like _SQSTM1_ with incomplete penetrance dependent on viral infection
## Pathophysiology
