# Pathology of the CNS parenchyma secondary to a vascular incident:
## Classification: [[Ischaemic stroke|Ischaemic]] vs Haemorrhagic
### [[Ischaemic stroke]] typically implies arterial pathology 
#### Venous ischaemic strokes include -> CVT and [[Venous sinus thrombosis|CVST]]
### Haemorrhagic strokes have lots of different classification schemes
#### Intimal tear -> typically [[Carotid dissection]]
#### Full vascular rupture -> disease depends on location 
##### Perforating vessels -> [[Intraparenchymal haemorrhage]] -> [[Lobar haemorrhage]], [[Basal ganglia haemorrhage]], [[Cerebellar haemorrhage]] [[Pontine haemorrhage]], [[Intraventricular haemorrhage]]
##### Superficial vessels -> [[Subarachnoid haemorrhage]]
##### Bridging veins -> [[Acute Sub-dural haemorrhage]]
##### Cranial arteries esp. Middle meningeal artery -> [[Epi-dural haemorrhage]]
