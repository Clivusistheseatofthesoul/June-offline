# Major cognitive dysfunction syndrome which is a subtype of the atypical parkinsonism syndromes -> most commonly seen in corticobasal degeneration
## Includes:
### Then apraxia asymmetrical UL motor presentation: [[Alien limb phenomenon]], can't unbutton shirt or brush hair, actions feel stiff or uncordinated 
### Most commonly -> Unilateral [[clumsy hand]], or stiff, gumby, or jerking arm 
#### Classically, [[Ideomotor apraxia]] in both arms or [[Limb-kinetic apraxia]]
### this then spreads to the LL and bilaterally 
### Oftentimes the cortical signs are localised all to one side -> either the aphasia-apraxia variant or the neglect variant 
## DDx:
### Most commonly by -> [[Corticobasal degeneration]]
### But can be caused by other forms of neurodegeneration -> [[Atypical parkinsonian diseases]]
