# Neglected elderly, aggrevated by dementia, altered mental status, physical disability -> hypovolaemic + hypernatraemic labs
## Tx:
1. Correct hypovolaemia first (more life threatening) -> 2L bolus normal saline -> not free water so much lower risk of cerebral oedema
2. Correct free H20 afterwards

See [[Hypernatraemia]] for maximum correction rate and calculation
