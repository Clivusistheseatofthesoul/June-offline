# Loss of corneal reflex, Loss of sensation in 1 or more CNV sensory distributions in 1 or more domains, atrophy and weakness of jaw opening
## Part of:
### [[Cavernous sinus syndrome]]
## Includes:
### Early -> [[Corneal reflex (absent)]] when testing the ipsilateral side only for both eyes
|                                | Stimulating ipsilateral eye | Stimulating contralateral eye |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ipsilateral trigeminal palsy   | Neither eye blinks          | Both eyes blink               |
| Contralateral trigeminal palsy |                             |                               |
| Ipsilateral Facial nerve palsy |                             |                               |
### [[Face distribution sensory loss]]
### Late -> atrophy of jaw muscles and weakness of jaw opening 
#### Jaw weakness is asymptomatic -> Closure is not tested as the massetter is the strongest muscle in the body and more than compensates
#### However opening (pyterigoids) are weaker -> will deviate to one side 

## DDx:
### When combined with other CN signs -> [[Vestibular schwannoma|Acoustic neuroma]] and other focal tumors at the cerebellopontine angle 
### painful stabs of facial pain in V2/V3 -> [[Trigeminal neuralgia]]
### Excruciating pain to the forehead Â± vesicular rash -> [[Herpes zoster opthalmicus]]

Mechanism: Destructive lesion to one or more branches of the trigeminal
- Nuclei -> trigeminal trunk emerges at the #cerebello_pontine_angle -> #Meckels_cave at tip of the #temporal_bone/petrous_portion where the #trigeminal_ganglion sits -> splits into the 3 divisions:
	- V1 opthalmic
	- V2 maxillary
	- V3 Mandibular
Seen in: #Neuro

Fibres most vulnerable to compression or distortion are those subserving the corneal reflex
