## Clinical features:
### On auscultation
#### Global murmur which runs through all the heart sounds 
##### S1 and S2 may re-emerge through the 'march' at the apex and lower left sternal border
##### Often described to be "machine like" -> but to me sounds more like marching in the distance when you put your ear to the ground
