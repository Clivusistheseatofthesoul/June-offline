## Aetiology
### If genetic, state most common association first in following structure
1.  Nomenclature for exonic variants: where X is Wild-type amino acid and Y is allele amino acid
	`Inherited/somatic + (inheritance pattern) + silent/misense/nonsense allele leading to -> Xxx-codon number-Yyy on _GENE_ locus (99p/q99) -> leading to LOF/GOF mutation causing + (describe effect and precipitants) `
2.  Nomenclature for intronic variants
	- 
3.  Nomenclature for repeat expansions
## Pathophysiology
### Mitochondrial compromise such that everything is converted to anaerobic respiration even in the prescence of plentiful oxygen
