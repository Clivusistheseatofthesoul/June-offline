# Summary
-   Escherichia coli is a normal component of the gut flora
    -   Initially, overwhelming expansion can cause diarrhoea with O157:H7 EHEC causing severe, haemorrhaagic and watery diarrhoea + Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
    -   when given the opportunity for expansion it can invade into surrounding mucosal and epidermal surfaces causing → UTI, Ascending cholangitis → eventually to distant organs which are **life-threatening** → Neonatal meningitis
    -   E. coli is a gram -ve rod 
	
# Aetiology
## Spread
## Pathogenicity

---
# Clinical manifestations
## [[Primary syphillis]] from initial infection
### Single painless [[Genital ulcers]] which often dosent even worry the patient + non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy
## If not treated -> progresses to [[Secondary syphillis]]
### Fever with [[Papulotargetoid acral rash]] on hands and feet
#### Also a [[Syphilitic alopecia]] and [[Condylomata lata]]
## Over years/decades -> T. pallidum eventually invades the vital organs -> [[Tertiary syphilis]]
### [[Neurosyphillis]]

# Tx 

-   E. coli is susceptible to cephalosporins
