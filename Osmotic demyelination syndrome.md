# Acute demyelination due to rapid correction of hyponatraemia
## Description:
### Fulminant progressive -> [[Quadriplegia]]
#### They have normal tone, [[Generalised Hypo-reflexia]]
### [[Pseudobulbar palsy]] with [[Pseudobulbar affect]] + attentional deficits -> [[Delirium]]
### [[Bulbar palsy]]
### Loss of pinprick/temperature in limbs and trunk
## Factors:
### **The duration of hyponatraemia** (i.e >48hrs = very high risk as neurons have adapted)
### [[Alcohol use disorder]] and [[Chronic liver disease]], [[Wilson's disease]] predispose to development of CPM, and may lower the threshold
## DDx: you've corrected hyponatraemia > 1 per 4 hrs you idiot

**Mehanism:** Hyponatraemia -> initial movement of free water into neurons -> initial cerebral oedema -> **cerebral adaption** to prevent cerebral oedema -> transcellular shift of Na+, K+, organic 'osmolytes' out of the cells into ECF **over days** -> Leaves neurons to shrink back to normal size at the expense of making them relatively lower osmolality than their immediate environment

Rapid administration of Na+ -> creates large osmotic gradient between hypertonic ECF and the adapted neuron ICF (which is even more hypotonic than expected due to the transcellular shift to adapt to the original hyponatraemia) -> sucks neurons dry -> neurons demyelinate
- Most common site is the **central basis pontis** (typically seen sandwhiched between the bridge of pons and pontine tegmentum)

**Seen in:** #Iatrogenic #Toxicity #Emergent
