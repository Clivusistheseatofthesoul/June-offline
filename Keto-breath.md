Mechanism: Ketogenesis due to reduced insulin:counter regulatory hormone ratio -> relative or absolute insulin deficiency -> adipose tissue engages lipolysis (starvation programme) -> increased FFA shunting to liver -> hepatocytes generate acetoacetate by ketogenesis -> spontaneously converts to **acetone** -> diffuses across the alveolar wall -> breathed out
