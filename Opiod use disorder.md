Aliases: Opiod dependence

# 
## Clinical features:
### [[Opiod toxicity]]
### [[Opiod withdrawal]]
### Satisfaction of addiction criteria:
![[Substance use disorders#Determine severity of use]]
## DDx:
### Most common -> secondary to long term prescription (non-prescribed use)[[Opiods]]
### From recreational source -> [[Heroin]], [[Fentanyl]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis
---
# Tx
## Acute reversal in [[Opiod toxicity]]
### IM or IV [[Naloxone]]




# Relapse prevention
## Social reintergration where possible is most successful in preventing relapse
### Long term recovery comes not from a magic bullet but from finding and replacing the substance/behavior with alternate rewards once withdrawal is controlled
### Sustain intimate relationship, hold a job they find is rewarding
## Pharmacological maintainence Tx
### Stabalise receptor occupancy with long acting agonist (controlled withdrawal and prevents intoxication, induced chronic tolerance to reduce euphoric effects of other opiods)
### Use one of the following three
|                   | [[Buprenorphine]] depot         | IM [[Naltrexone]] | [[Methadone]]            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Advantages        | Safer in OD, dosen't prolong QT |                   | Safe in CKD              | 
| Contraindications | Higher drop-out rate currently  |                   | Rapid methadone clearers |

# Prognosis
## Drop out rates are high -> patient's often cycle in and out of pharmacological Tx
### 1 year retention is 50% with methadone and 30% in buprenorphine
## If retention to programme -> 50-75% caease heroin use
### However all other drug use remains quite common

---
## Complications
### [[IV drug use]] -> self-neglect, demoralisation and loss of identity and someones own 'niche'
### Induction of tolerance with methadone maintainence Tx is associated with an increased risk of death due to iatrogenic induced [[Opiod toxicity]]
#### Induction occurs too quickly for the patient's level of tolerance
#### Patient's with reduced methadone clearance
#### Patient's using concomittant [[Benzos]], [[TCAs]] or [[Alcohol use disorder|Alcoholism]]

## Aetiology
### Some people remain as 'chippers' -> remember even these people are at risk of complications from [[IV drug use]]
## Pathophysiology
