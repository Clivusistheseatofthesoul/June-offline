# [[Hypercalcaemia]] due to underlying neoplasm
## Clinical features:
###
## DDx:
### Bony mets -> [[Osteolytic bone mets]] -> release of Ca2+ and PO4+
### Paraneoplastic syndrome -> [[SCC lung cancer]] producing PTH-rp
## Mimics:
### Hypervitaminosis D 
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Elevated Ca2+ and PO4+
#### PTH will be suppressed in either case
#### **Vitamin D not required**, only done if you suspect vitamin D toxicity
### Aetiology is determined by PO4+ level
#### Elevated PO4+ -> Lytic lesions constantly producing PO4+
#### Reduced PO4+ -> PTH-rp pretending to be PTH -> inappropriately increasing PTH -> acts on kidney which maintains Ca2+ and flushes PO4+ away
##### Should get a PTH-rp level to confirm
