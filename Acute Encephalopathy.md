# Non-localising diffuse neurological dysfunction, from a suspected systemic organic aetiology, that is not a classic dementia. 

## Signs and symptoms:
### [[Delirium]],  specifically [[Altered mental status]] ->[[coma]]

## DDx:
### Toxic causes -> due to exogenous substance or pathogen
#### Drugs -> [[Opiods]], [[Anti-cholinergics]]
#### Fever -> Pyrexia 
#### Local Infection -> [[UTI]], [[Pyelonephritis]],  [[Encephalitis]] -> but also just [[Acute urinary retention]]
#### Systemic infection -> [[Sepsis]]
#### Intoxication and withdrawral -> [[Benzos]], [[Alcohol intoxication]], [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome]], [[Benzo withdrawal]] -> Also [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]]
### Metabolic causes -> due to endogenous organ failure
#### Haemodynamic -> [[Hypertensive crisis]] -> [[Hypertensive encephalopathy]], [[Hepatic encephalopathy]]
#### Pulmonary -> O2 and CO2 -> [[Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy]], [[Hypercapnic encephalopathy]], [[Methaemoglobinaemia]]
#### Endocrine -> [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]], [[Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia state|HHS]], [[Hypos]], [[Thyroid storm]], or severe [[Hypothyroidism]] causing [[Myxoedema coma]], [[Adrenal crisis|Addisonian crisis]]
#### Renal -> [[Ureamic encephalopathy]]


### Combined causes -> exogenous exacerbation of endogenous organ failure or vice versa
#### Seizures -> [[Abscence seizures]], [[Cognitive seizure]]
#### Drug interaction and poor dosing regimen -> [[Serotonin Syndrome]], [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]
#### Electrolyte -> Electrolyte disturbances -> Na+ and Ca2+ specifically
#### Acid/base -> [[Acidotic encephalopathy]]
#### Enzyme deficiency -> [[Porphyria]],  and psychiatric signs in [[Wilson's disease]] can also masquerade as 'encephalopathy'
#### Psychosis -> [[Psychosis]], [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]

---
- Acute encephalopathy is rapidly progressive (onset over hours-days; lasts for less than 4 weeks) pathobiological disruption of **general brain function** -> from a systemic, **organic** cause 
	- Acute encephalopathy is reversible when the incident aetiolgy is corrected
	- Causes are divided into:
		1. Toxic -> medications, recreational drugs, toxic chemical ingestion
		2. Metabolic -> metabolic disturbance
		3. Toxic-metabolic -> combination of the 2
- Acute encephalopathy can present as: [[Delirium]], sub-syndromal delirium, reduced LOC, [[Altered mental status]] -> [[coma]]
