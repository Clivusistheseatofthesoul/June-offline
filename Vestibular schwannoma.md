Aliases: Acoustic neuroma

# Typically compressing CN V, VII and VIII @ the cerebellopontine angle 
## Clinical features: Characterised by egregiously slow progression (30+ years!)
### Earliest symptoms are typically associated with the auditory division of CN VIII -> Unilateral progressive [[Sensorineural deafness]]
### Other early features of the other nerves are: [[Corneal reflex (absent)]] and [[Hemifacial spasm]]
### [[Trigeminal palsy]] -> reflex dissappearing first, then sensory deficit then lastly jaw muscle weakness
### [[Facial nerve palsy]] is a late sign! If it is early -> consider mimics
### Due to ability for other cranial nerve to distort freely -> Acoustic neuromas can become quite large to compress the brainstem and cerebellum
#### Cerebellum -> [[Central Vertigo]], [[Cerebellar ataxia]]
##### Limb Ataxia is most marked in Upper limb ipsilateral to tumor
#### Pons -> mild [[Scissoring gait]]-> [[Spastic paraparesis]] -> [[Spastic quadriparesis]]
### Very late -> aqueduct compression -> [[Obstructive hydrocephalus]] -> [[Raised ICP headache]], [[Papiloedema]]
## DDx:
### Bilateral acoustic neuromas -> [[Neurofibromatosis type II]]
## Mimics: Look for early facial nerve palsy 
### Cholesteatoma, meninigoma, exophytic Focal pontine glioma
