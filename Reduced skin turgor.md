Mechanism: Normal skin turgor is dependent on collagen, elastin and
fluid content → dehydration → reduced fluid content of skin

Sign: Skin turgor (or skin elasticity) is indicated by retaining of 'tenting' after the skin is pinched from the back of the hand (adults) or the abdomen (children)

Reduced skin turgor is one of the first signs of volume depletion (hypovolaemia)

- However it is not a reliable sign to ellicit in elderly individuals → which will have positive skin tenting regardless of fluid content
