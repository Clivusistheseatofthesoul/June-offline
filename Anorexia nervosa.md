## Clinical features:
### Overvalued ideas of being overweight when they are actually underweight -> malnourished -> [[Emaciated]] -> [[Starvation]]
#### Typically an overvalued idea, although sometimes can progress into somatic delusion
#### Intense [[Fear]] of gaining weight which is not alleviated by weight reduction 
### O/E: see someone who is hypothyroid but *thin* -> [[Cold intolerance]] but [[Emaciated]]
#### [[Lanugo]]
#### [[Secondary Amenorrhea]] or [[Primary amenorrhea]] if pre-pubertal
#### Weight -> BMI must be low 
### Weight restriction behavior
#### Classically restriction of food intake, fasting -> restriction subtype
#### If there is evidence of [[binge|binging]] and [[Purging]] -> called the binge-purge subtype of anorexia nervosa
#### Other behaviors include: [[Extreme excercise]] and over-excercise
### All of their goals and beliefs are egosyntonic -> which are social contagions as well as impact's on children -> +ve FHx
## DDx:
### Secondary to body weight dysregulation genetics
#### or 'Primary anorexia'
##### They don't have many friends, will hate to be included into standard group programme -> and will do anything to leave
##### "I'm not sick at all"
### 'Me too anorexia'
#### Secondary to social contagion on vulnerable personality trait
##### They will have friends with anorexia, and will want to be in a group programme -> and they are hard to kick out
##### "I wasn't sick enough"
## Mimics:
### binge-purge subtype of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are similar
#### Anorexia nervosa has Low BMI, while bulimia nervosa has normal BMI
## Workup:
### Clinical diagnosis:
#### Must have all 4 core features
##### Drive for thinness -> intense fear of gaining weight
##### Drive for thinness -> distorted body image

## Forced admission criteria
### Extreme anorexia (BMI < 16)
## Nutritional support
### Initial calories supplied must be just above the resting energy expenditure 
### IV fluids with electrolytes to prevent refeeding syndrome
#### Prophylactic PO4-, thiamine to prevent onset
### If NG feeds required -> they need 1 on 1 supervision
#### They will do ANYTHING. to stop the feeding
## Start outpatient therapy while they are here
### **Anti-psychotics are first line**!!!
#### Typically [[Olanzapine]] or [[Quetiapine]]
#### SSRI/SNRI if OCD or MDD concomittant 
### With CBT as adjunct
#### If child < 15 y/o -> MFBT will work in 50% of children

# Enduring anorexia nervosa
## Emphasis on harm minimisation with door always open to eventual recovery
## 80% do recover eventually -> those that don't are said to have severe enduring anorexia nervosa
### 1/3 take 9 years to recover
### Another 1/3 take 9-22 years to recover
### 75% of all patients recovered **by 33 years**
## However, disease of > 15 years has a significantly increased risk of completed [[Suicide]]

## Complications
![[Pasted image 20210414123949.png]]
### Either enteral or parenteral refeeding -> [[Refeeding syndrome]] and [[Steatohepatitis]]
#### Will need to reduce nutritional support and correct electrolytes 
### Comorbidity with other mental health disorders is the rule not the exception 
#### [[Major depressive disorder|MDD]] occurs secondarily 
#### If there are comorbid OCD or MDD -> use first line of SSRI/SNRI instead
### [[Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea]] -> can't get pregnant -> extensive obstetric complications
#### And their babies will be predisposed to being [[Anorexia nervosa]] and [[T2DM]]
#### Anorexia beget's anorexia 
### Susceptible to bacterial infections, but protective of viral infections mostly  
####  [[Myelosuppression]]

---
## Aetiology
### Particular personality disposition
#### Genetic influence + OCD personality disorder + mild ASD 
### Effect of starvation itself perpetuating cognitive changes + binge-purge behavior
#### See Minnesota starvation study
### Fear of letting go of the eating disorder due to loss of agency the behaviors imbue

## Pathophysiology
### Production of **low self worth** in both primary and secondary groups
