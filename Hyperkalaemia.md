# Serum [K+] > 5.5
## Clinical features: typically neds to be > 6.5
### Weakness initially in legs then arms -> fulminant [[Symmetric ascending weakness]] very similar the GBS
### Arrythmias -> [[Palpitations]], [[Syncope]]
### Aetiology is typically obvious on history
#### ESKD, Heart failure meds, medication change
## DDx:
### Excess K+ intake (profoundly) -> only occurs when they also have [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]]
#### 
### Low aldosterone state
#### RAAS blockade -> [[ACEi]], [[ARBs]], [[Spironalectone]], [[Eplerenone]]	
### Renal failure -> occurs in End stage [[Chronic kidney disease|CKD]]
### Lab artefact -> due to haemolysis from pumping their hand
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Labs then ECG
##### Repeat labs if the hyperkalaemia was not forseen -> if truely elevated -> get ECG
### ECG derrangement dictates severity of Mx
#### Classic ECG progression -> "Unstable hyperkalaemia" -> **Emergent**
##### Peaked T waves + [[Conduction abnormalities|Heart blocks]] -> QRS complex widens -> Sine wave arrest

#### No changes -> "Stable hyperkalaemia" -> fix at leisure -> urgent
##### Only requires resonium to eliminate total K+

# Tx
## Urgency of repletion determined by ECG features
### Prescence of any ECG derrangement (any heart block or peaked T waves) with high K+ indicates treatment 
## Stabalise cardiac membranes
### IV Calcium gluconate or CaCl
## Temporise K+ excess by ionic shift
### IV insulin 10U + 1 ampule of D50 (avoid hypoglycaemia) will shift K+ into cells
### Alternatives:
#### Nebulised beta agonists
## Eliminate K+ 
### [[Resonium]] 
### Alternative
#### Loop diuretics can induce renal wasting, but most people have CKD so this wont work
### If dialysis dependent -> just haemodialyse


---
## Complications
### Arrythmias like -> [[AFib]] but also acutely dangerous ones like [[VT]] and [[Torsades de pointes]]
#### Risk is increased with
##### [[Hypomagnesaemia]]
##### [[Myocardial infarction|MI]]
##### [[Digitalis toxicity|Digoxin toxicity]] and other QT prolonging drugs
