# Imbalance and overt unsteadiness most obvious when standing and attempting to walk
## Supportive features:
### Abscence of vertigo
### Reported -> tendency to imbalanced and going to fall without loss of consciousness -> [[Drop attacks]]
### [[Romberg's sign]], [[Postural instability]]
## DDx:
### Acute onset -> vascular event
### Progressive, insidious timecourse -> [[PSP]], [[Multiple system atrophy]], [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]] both lesion the pedunculopontine nucleus

Mechanism: Destructive lesion in 2/3 afferent inputs into the cerebellum or motor integration centre output after the cerebellum
- #vestibular_nuclei <-> fastigial nuclei + #cerebellum/flocculonodular_cerebellum 
- Post-cerebellar motor postural integration for walking: #Midbrain/inferior_midbrain/pedunculopontine_nucleus_pars_compacta
Seen in: #Neuro #neurodegeneration #Ischaemia

Some may report unsteadiness, although there is little evidence in the neurologic examination
- Others are so unsteady that they cannot stand or even sit up unassisted
