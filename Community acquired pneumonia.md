# [[Pneumonia]] in those who are not hospitalised or those who have been hospitalised < 48hrs
## Clinical features:
### [[Fever]] with classically a [[wet cough]] (and if with clear consolidation on CXR) -> that is automatically pneumonia
#### Supportive features are -> [[Chills, rigors]], [[Pleuritic chest pain]]
#### Atypical pneumonias can present with [[Dry cough]] and predominance of non-specific systemic findings
## DDx:
### Most common -> [[S. pneumoniae]]
### COPD'ers -> [[H. influenzae]]
### CF -> can get [[P. aeruginosa]]
### [[Walking pneumonia|Atypical pneumonia]]
### Others:
#### [[S. aureus]] -> with MSSA more common than MRSA and associated with post-influenza pneumonia
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### See [[Pneumonia]]

# Tx
## Initial antibiotics
### If mild -> Amoxicillin ± Clarithromycin
#### Don't need to do combination if followup within 48hrs
### If moderate -> IV benzylcillin + Doxycycline/Clarithromycin
### If severe -> Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin
#### If suspecting [[S. aureus]] -> add Vancomycin
##### Suspect if:
- Rapid progression to sepsis
- Occurs right after episode of influenza infection
- Radiological appearance of: cavitary or necrotising pneumonia with multilobar consolidation
#### If suspecing Pseudomonnas -> Replace ceftriazone azithromycin with Cefepime/Piptazo + azithromycin ± gentamycin (if septic)
##### Suspect if:
- Has [[Cystic fibrosis]] or [[Bronchiectasis]]
- AND either:
	- Gram -ve bacilli on sputum or blood culture
	- Current sepsis/septic shock
#### if walking pneumonia -> Azithromycin alone

## Complications
### Necrotising pneumonia esp. from S. aureus and Streptococcal infections
### Parapneumonic [[Pleural effusion]] -> [[Pleural empyema]]
