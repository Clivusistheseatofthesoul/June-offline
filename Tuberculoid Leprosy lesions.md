# Erythematous ring-like lesions with pale centers which may be numb
## Description:
### Not said to be annular mainly because of the sloped ill defined borders
### Said to resemble a 'saucer right way up' with a pale dry center -> Loss of sweating with rough dry hairless skin in the patches
### Anaesthesia in the central portion 
#### If occuring in the face -> there may be no reported anaesthesia as the dense innervation overcomes sensory loss
## DDx:
### [[Leprosy]]
