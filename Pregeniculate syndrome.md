# Destructive lesions to the sensory optic pathway occuring before the LGN produce clinical features very different to those that affect the remaining postgeniculate pathway
## Includes:
### Progressive visual defect -> Inability to detect [[Red pin test|red-pin]] -> white pin -> moving finger (absolute visual defect)
### Pupillary signs -> [[RAPD]]
### Potentially optic disk atrophy
