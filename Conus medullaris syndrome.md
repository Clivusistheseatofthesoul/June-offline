# Conus medullaris syndrome
## Description:
### Sudden and bilateral onset 
### Bilateral leg pain + [[Spastic paraparesis|Spastic paraplegia]]
### [[Perianal anaesthesia]] tends to be more localized to perianal area
#### More symmetrical and bilateral than cauda equina syndrome
### Bowel and bladder features present early in course
#### [[Faecal incontinence]], [[Urinary retention]] -> urinary [[Overflow incontinence]]
### Pudendal -> [[Erectile dysfunction]] more frequent than cauda equina syndrome
### Legs -> Typically bilateral [[ankle reflex (absent)]] OR [[Hyper-reflexive ankle reflex]] + can have [[Babinsksi's sign]] I.e plantars upgoing
#### Knee reflexes are spared in conus medullaris syndrome
### Key feature is **absent** lower limb reflexes I.e **arreflexia**
## DDx:
### Acute L2/3 midline disc prolapse
## Mimics:
### Cauda equina syndrome
### ACA infarction -> would initially produce a flaccid leg but always has hyper-reflexia!
