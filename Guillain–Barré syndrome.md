# Fulminant post-infectious demyelinating mixed peripheral neuropathy -> although the overt deficit is motor
## Subtypes:
### Adult subtypes: [[Miller-Fisher Syndrome]]
### [[Peadiatric GBS]]
## Clinical features: Acute monophasic progressive paresis provoked by recent infection
### Sensory symptoms are earliest -> [[Acute Symemtric ascending sensory loss]] + [[Toe and fingertip paresthesia]] -> generally does not ascend past the wrist/ankle
### Distal [[Symmetric ascending weakness]] which progresses over hours-days -> worst at 2 weeks potentially with Respiratory paralysis and/or cranial nerve palsy -> [[Acute Dyspnoea]] despite Hypoventilation
#### [[Absent reflexes]], [[Flaccid paraplegia]] ascends to -> [[Flaccid quadriplegia]] if severe 
#### [[Bilateral reduced air entry]], [[Diminished breath sounds]]
### Cranial nerves are involved typically late: CNVIII is typically spared
#### [[LMN facial weakness]], [[Dysphagia]], [[Flaccid Dysarthria]], [[Diplopia]]
### Acute onset [[Autonomic failure]]
#### Fickle BP, [[Absent bowel sounds]], [[Suprapubic pain]] and [[Suprapubic fullness]]
### Secondary to flu-like illness few weeks ago 
## DDx:
### Respiratory or gastrointestinal infection 2-4 weeks ago -> [[C. jejuni]] -> screen for acute diarrhoea
## Mimics:
### Acute ascending polyneuropathies include Dry beriberi from thiamine deficiency
## Workup:
### LP
#### Isolated high protein > 0.4
