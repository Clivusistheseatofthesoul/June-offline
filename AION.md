# [[Optic neuropathy]] caused by ischaemic damage to the optic disk
## Clinical features:
### Painless monocular blindness progressive over hours-days
#### NAION presents suddenly upon wakening
#### AAION presents with features of [[GCA]] Â± [[Polymyalgia rheumatica]]
#### Typically either [[Unilateral Central scotoma]] or inferior [[Altitudinal visual defect]]
### Ipsilateral [[RAPD]]
### Pale segmental disc edema, retinal dot, [[Flame haemorrhages]]
## DDx:
### Currently idioptahic but multifactorial aetiology likely inolved -> [[Atherosclerosis]] of the opthalmic artery -> Non-arteric AION -> NAION
#### Risk factors include:
##### [[Obstructive sleep apnoea|OSA]] 
##### Drug side effect -> [[Sildenafil]] -> exxagerates physiologic nocturnal arterial hypotension
### [[GCA|Giant cell arteritis]] -> Arteric AION -> AAION

## Aetiology
### Idiopathic cause of reduced optic disk autoregulation -> atherosclerosis or arteritis + further exacerbation of nocturnal hypotension -> hypoperfusion of the optic disk
