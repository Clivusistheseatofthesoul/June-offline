Prosopagnosia is typically caused by either bilateral lesioning to the fusiform face area on the fusiform gyrus or lesioning of **right fusiform gyrus alone.** There are 2 main classifications of prosopagnosia:

- Perceptive prosopagnosia: inability to perceive faces
- Associative prosopagnosia: inability to recognise familiar faces (and potentially one's own face also)
