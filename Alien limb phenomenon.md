### Typically in a arm -> classically the left arm 
### Apraxic difficulty to perform even the most basic task -> 'arm having a mind of its own'
#### Frontal variant is associated with -> [[Environmental dependancy]], [[Utilisation behavior]] and often having prominent grasp reflex, forced groping, magnetic and levitating movements

#### Sensory/posterior variant is rare but is associated with hand levitations, the feeling of 'foreignness of the hand' -> associated with combination cerebellar, optic and sensory ataxia
### Occasionally this is paroxysmal loss of control -> associated with frontomedial focal seizure
## DDx

#### esp. disconnection of non-dominant post. pareital lobe from rest of brain 
#### and ACA infarction of medial frontal region/septal region
#### Iatrogenic -> Commissurotomy 
### Primary neurodegeneration
#### [[Corticobasal degeneration]], [[familial CJD]]
