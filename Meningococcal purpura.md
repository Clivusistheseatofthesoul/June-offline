# Non-palpable, Non-blanching, non-itchy rash which progresses → [[petechiae]] → darkens in colour → enlargement in size → eventually ecchymoses and [[Palpable purpura]] 
## Description:
### Non-palpable, non-blanching [[Petechiae]] -> [[Purpura]] -> [[Palpable purpura]] -> [[Ecchymoses]]
### Background of [[Fever]]

## DDx:
### [[N. meningitidis]] -> [[Meningococcal sepsis]] often occuring in the context of a suspected acute Meningococcal [[Pyogenic meningitis]]

## Mimics:
### [[Typhoid fever]]

**Mechanism:** Meningococcemia (due to [[N. meningitidis]]) → septic thrombi → toxic damage to endothelia of microvasculature
**Seen in:** #Neuro, #infection, #Emergent

Starts as Petechiae (rash of small red spots that do not disappear when pressure is applied to the skin, aka just small purpura) occurs in 50–75% of cases.
- These are typically found on the trunk and limbs

Lodging of infectious thromboses into the microvasculature → terminal sprouting toxic damage to the endothelial walls → terminal vessel haemorrhage → superficial skin necrosis → creating a reddish tone

- Clustered petechiae on the thorax, notice that this rash is much harder to see on dark skinned individuals (check thorax, tummy, sole, palm, mouth and eyelid) -  Image taken from DermNetNZ (2020)


Petechiae on the distal limbs with development of focal dermal haemorrhage. This will develop into ecchymoses and limb necrosis if not intervened

- Even early stage red petechiae does not blanch with the glass jar test. This is because the redness develops from microvascular haemorrhage → pooling of blood in the dermis, and **not from oedema** 
- These may become palpable if grown big enough

The rash may progress to larger red patches or purple lesions (i.e bruises → ecchymoses). In late disease these lesions burst in the distal extremities and lead to limb necrosis → limb amputation.

As the sepsis progresses, there is larger calibre vessel collapse → full thickness skin necrosis → eventual distal limb gangrene

Notice the lower limb petechiae and subsequent ecchymoses in darker skinned individuals are much harder to see just by bedside inspection. Look for bruising at the paler parts
