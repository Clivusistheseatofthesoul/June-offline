# Regular rhythmic contraction of muscle groups after stretching the muscle group during the reflex exam, or during 'wiggle and a wang test' -> typically accompanied by 4+ reflexes
## Part of:
### [[UMN signs]], [[Serotonin Syndrome]]

---
Mechanism: Impaired supraspinal inhibition or excessive peripheral 5-HT agonism results in a self-sustaining stretch reflex which reactivates at the end of each cycle

Clonus is a UMN sign. Clonus is most commonly ellicited by either normal testing for the reflexes or during the wiggle and a wag test. Clonus is resultant of **pronouced hyper-reflexia**
- Typically seen on both Wiggle and wang + present on testing for reflexes
- The knee must be slightly bent 
- Relax the ankle by giving it a few wiggles, holding the tip of the foot at the ball and the distal dorsum of the foot
- suddenly give it a strong 'wag' → i.e abruptly dorsiflex the ankle then hold your hand near the ball of the foot to see if it 'taps back'
- When see in conjunction with: fever, tachycardia, hypertension, altered mental status and tremors → is highly suspicious of **serotonin syndrome**
