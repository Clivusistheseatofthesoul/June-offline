# Serum [Na+] > 145
## Approach:
### 1. Get Serum Osm, Urinary [Na+], Urinary Osm
### 2. Determine aetiology (Most of the time will be an unwatered vegetable)
### 3. Replete **accordingly** and not too fast
## DDx: Classified by urine Osm
### Concentrated pee -> [[Unwatered vegetables]] -> neglected [[Elderly]] or child oftentimes with [[Dementia]] (or unable to speak) -> can not express thirst -> free water deficit + hypovolaemic
#### Labs -> urine Osm > 600
### Normal pee -> Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus causing osmotic diuresis -> [[Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia state]] or [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]]
#### Labs -> 350 < urine Osm < 600
### Super dilute pee -> Endocrine causes -> isolated free water deficit -> [[Diabetes insipidus]]
#### Labs -> urine Osm < 350

## Tx
### Route
#### Free water preferred in this order: Oral water > IV one of the following solutions:
### Drugs
#### Hypotonic fluids (1/2 and 1/4 normal saline; only when hypotonic fluid loss is the cause) 
#### D5W (only in confirmed isolated free water loss i.e diabetes insipidus) 
### Max Rate
#### Chronic hypernatraemia (>48hrs) -> correct < 10 each 24hrs E.g from 165-155 in a day maximum!
#### Acute hypernatraemia (<48hrs) -> correct to normal over 24hr period irrespective of starting hypernatraemic value
### Push rate

### Followup
#### Serum [Na+] and choice of fluid should be reassessed every 2-8hrs
