Aliases: Obsessive compulsive disorder
---
# 
## Clinical features:
### [[Obsessions]] are thoughts which act as internal stimuli 
#### Must be **intrusive unwanted** thoughts or preoccupations -> thoughts pushed in that you worry about and don't wan';t to do, and do you do anything about it?
##### Can be an image
#### No trigger which sets of trigger -> but internal, recurrent popup's
#### These are not amendable to logic -> they just incessantly appear there egodystonically
### Most people get the obsessions -> but those with OCD -> takes on so much power that it becomes associated with [[Fear]] and is self-managed with compulsions
### Compulsions are actions which reduce anxiety 
#### Like breathing -> you can hold off from doing it for a while -> but the need for air will drive you to breathe... eventually
#### Generally a behavior or a even a mental ritual
### Most commonly they occur in pairs
| Obsession      | Compulsion                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Safety         | Lock, window checking, turning off stove |
