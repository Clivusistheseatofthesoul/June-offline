Aliases: Acute non-mechanical intestinal obstruction, Paralytic ileus

# Acute Functional [[Bowel obstruction]] (from non-mechanical cause) generalised to the entire bowel 
## Clinical features:
### [[Elderly]] and critically ill 
### Typically diffuse, **constant**, [[Acute abdomen in adult]] or [[Acute abdomen in child]]
###
## DDx:
### Occuring secondary to Iatrogenic insult esp Post-abdominal surgery -> [[Post-operative ileus]]
### Ileus which is not associated with surgery -> paralytic ileus
#### Secondary to a more emergent condition causing Peritoneal irritation -> [[Acute peritonitis]], [[Acute pancreatitis]] 
#### Secondary to severe medical illness -> [[Sepsis]], electrolyte derrangement, Acute fulminant [[Autonomic neuropathy]]
#### Drug toxicity -> [[Opiods]], [[Anti-cholinergics]]
#### Other MedHx -> [[Hypothyroidism]]
#### Electrolyte disturbance -> [[Hypokalaemia]]

## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis
---
# Tx

---
## Complications
###

---
## Aetiology
### Convergent causes of impaired peristalsis w/o mechanical involvement
## Pathophysiology
