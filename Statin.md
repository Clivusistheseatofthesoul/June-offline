# Used in hypercholesterolaemia to reduce LDL by acting as HMG-coreductase inhibitor
## Includes:
### Atorvostatin (Lipitor); Rosuvostatin (Crestor)
## Indications: Everybody benefits, the pre-intervention absolute risk score predicts the magnitude of benefit! 
### Anybody with complications of, or prooven atherosclerosis (E.g Ischaemic strokes, carotid artery stenosis, CAD, PVD etc)
### Elevated LDL (LDL > 4.9mM), or total cholesterol > 7.5
#### If between 1.8-4.9 they still get a statin if:
##### Their age is between 40-75 AND they have T1DM or T2DM
##### OR
##### Their age is between 40-75 AND they have a significant score on Framingham risk score
## Side effects:
### Statin induced myositis -> [[Necrotising autoimmune myopathy]] -> [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
### Statin induced hepatotoxicity (insufficient dat)
# Countra indications
## Established active liver disease
## Episode of statin induced rhabdomyolysis
## Avoid use with [[Macrolides]] -> [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
# Administration 
## Goal is always high-intensity statin 
### Atorvastatin 40-80mg or Rosuvostatin 20-40mg
## If they canno't tolerate high intensity, or drug interactions, liver or kidney failure or age >75 -> move to moderate intensity
### Atorvastatin 10-20mg or Rosuvostatin 5-10mg
# Monitering
## Baseline before starting ensure you have:
### Lipid panel, HbA1C, CK, LFTs
## Recheck following:
### Recheck lipids annually
### HbA1C if diabetic
### Do not screen with CK or LFTs -> only check IF symptomatic
## If statin induced myositis -> STOP statin

## If statin induced hepatitis -> STOP statin
## Once they recover -> restart at moderate intensity :) 
## If you really can't use them -> move to [[Fibrates]]
## If they aren't working -> check adherence and move to additional therapy with [[Ezetimibe]] or [[PCSK9 inhibitor]] as per [[Dyslipidaemia#Tx|Lipid modification guidelines]]
