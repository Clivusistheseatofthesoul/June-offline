## Clinical features:
### [[Depressive mood]], [[Anhedonia]] which is significantly impacting their role
#### Perceptual deficits
##### Everything appears black/desaturated, all the foods taste the same
### Depression can occur in peads -> with adolescents >> than children
### There are various clinical syndromes which people can present with:
#### When presenting with [[Melancholia]] -> [[Melancholic depression]]
#### [[Atypical depression]]
#### When presenting with [[Catatonia]] -> [[Catatonic depression]]
#### When presenting with [[Psychosis|psychotic]] features -> [[Psychotic depression]]
### There are additional specifiers:

## DDx:
### 
## Mimics:
### Other Depressive disorders 
#### Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
### Other psychiatric disorders
#### Adjustment disorder with depressed mood
#### If significant psychotic component -> Schizoaffective disorder
### Bipolar II must have major depression like episodes -> and will become mania if given an SSRI!
### Elderly admission with 'depression' -> oftentimes mistaken for
#### Hypoactive delirium 
## Workup:
### Clinical diagnosis
#### Either [[Depressive mood]] OR [[Anhedonia]]
#### Duration of 2 or more weeks
#### Present with 5+ of *SIGECAPS*

# Acute Tx
## Indications for admission
### Severe depression with immediate suicidal risk or medical risk
### Depression with recent loss of social support or unsafe household
# Chronic Tx
## Mild-moderate requires psychotherapy only
### Typically CBT but other available
#### MBCT for those prone to worry
#### ACT for those who need to accept and adjust to persisting problems
## Moderate-severe requires combination psychotherapy + meds
### [[Agomelatine]], [[SSRI]] or [[SNRI]] always first line
#### Second line [[Vortioxetine]], [[MAOis]]
### Typically CBT but other available
#### MBCT for those prone to worry
#### ACT for those who need to accept and adjust to persisting problems
## If Trial augmentation agents
#### [[Lithium]], [[Atypical anti-psychotics]]
### rTMS adjunct
## ECT only in those completely refractory + meeting certain criteria:
### Psychotic depression
### catatonic depression

# Treatment resistant depression
## If partial response to previous Tx and has a true diagnosis of primary treatment resistant depression 


---
## Complications
### Depression, esp. depression with [[Mixed mood states|mixed features]] (20%) -> oftentimes progress into [[Bipolar I]]
### Treatment of hidden Bipolar II or I disease in the depressive phase with SSRI -> reveals underlying mania -> precipitates acute mania through [[TEAS]]
#### Thus mood disorders are life-long chronic disease
