# Use and moa
## Includes:
### Sinemet -> levo-DOPA + carbi-DOPA
## Indications:
## Side effects:
### Nausea occurs at the start of therapy -> then fades away with chronic intake
### [[Orthostatic hypotension]] due to peripheral carbidopa
### Extra-pyramidal side effects: chorea and dystonia 
#### These are predicted by **duration of levo-DOPA therapy** and not dosage of levo-DOPA that predicts hyperkinetic movement disorder side-effects
### Acute confusion and psychotic episode -> DO NOT STOP levo-DOPA -> start clozapine or quetiapine 
### Suddenly stopping levo-DOPA causes [[Akinetic-rigid crisis]]
# Countra indications
# Administration 
## Start low at PO 50+12.5mg sinemet 3x daily
## Gradually uptitrate to 100+25mg sinemet 3x daily over 2 weeks
## Take with food at the start to help with nausea
### If nausea is still a problem -> Domperidone 10 mg orally, 3 times daily for up to 7 days, **then stop** to avoid the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death
#### ALways use domperidone over others as they can cross the BBB
## Over time -> as they develop extra-pyramidal SEs -> giving drugs 1 hour before meals prevents interference with absorption 
# Monitering 
# Stopping
## NEVER, **EVER** suddenly stop levo-DOPA
