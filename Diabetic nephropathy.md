---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### Accumulation of AGE -> inflammatory response -> deposition of type IV collage in glomeruli -> mesangial cell proliferation and hyalinosis -> BM hypertrophy -> nodular glomerulosclerosis 
#### BM hypertrophy -> only albumin leaks through -> Microalbuminuria
### Initial damage -> shunting of bloodflow to other glomeruli and glomerular and tubular hypertrophy
#### Initial increase in GFR
### Eventual destruction of sufficient glomeruli to reduce overall kidney function
#### Drop in GFR
### Eventual scarring and sclerosis of glomeruli mesangium
#### Proteins bigger than albumin leak through -> [[Proteinuria]]
