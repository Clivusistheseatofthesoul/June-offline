# Skin infection through into the hypodermis and associated fascia
## Clinical features:
### Sick as shit person with cellulitis
#### [[Fever]], generally feeling like trash -> [[Hypotension]] etc
### Sick as shit skin ± sick person
#### **Purple or black** blistering skin with [[Skin crepitations]] with [[Pain out of proportion]] in the skin 
##### Malodourous discharge!!! 
##### Sometimes for C. perfringens -> early phase can have this bronze discolouration before -> purple and bullae
![[Nec fac.png]]
##### In severe scenarios can be -> [[Haemorrhagic bullae]]
#### Can be associated with [[Sensory loss]] if cutting through nerves -> [[Pain out of proportion]] of the injury -> esp. when the pain extends beyond the region of [[Erythema]]
#### Can occur in the groin area -> [[Fournier's gangrene]]
### Always look out for
#### [[T2DM]] and [[T1DM]], [[Immunocompromised patient]] and [[NSAID]] use
#### [[Chronic liver disease]]
#### [[Obesity]] -> increased hypodermis compartment -> more space of relative hypoxia
#### [[IV drug use]] esp at the injection site 
## DDx:		
### [[S. pyogenes]] and [[C. perfringens]] most common
#### Clostridium perfringens infection specifically referred to as Clostridial myonecrosis or 'Gas gangrene'
### [[V. vulnificus]] esp. consider in those with [[Chronic liver disease]]
## Mimics:
### [[Krokodil]] drug abuse
###
## Workup:
### On clinical suspicion, diagnosed with imaging
---
# Tx
## Start broad spec -> Vancomycin + piptazo/meropenum + [[Clindamycin]] ± ciprofloxacin
### Ciprofloxacin is add-on and piptazo is swapped for meropenum -> if infection is associated with wound immersed in water (Aeromonas)
## Image the suspected nec fac
### X-ray area to look for gas
### MRI area 
## Surgical involvement early -> consult surgery early even before the results come back 
## If -ve de-escalate to [[Cellulitis]] abx regimen
## Once cultures return for surgery -> de-escalate
### If Vibrio vulnificans -> de-escalate to Ceftriaxone + doxycycline
### If Streptococcus pyogenes 
#### Benzylpenicilin + clindamycin + IVIg
### If Clostridium perfringens
#### Benzylpenicillin + [[Clindamycin]]
