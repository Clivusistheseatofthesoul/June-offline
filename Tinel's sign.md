# Tinel's sign

Mechanism: Chronically increased pressure on median nerve → if already hypersensitised will have altered membrane sensitivity → increased mechanosensitivity → parasthesias in median nerve distribution when tapped
Part of: Carpal%20tunnel%20syndrome%20ca1d0d3e470c41b7aef3071cb96befe6.md
Seen in: PNS
Sign: tapping over the flexor side of the wrist for up to 30s to ellicit parasthesias in the fingers

This sign is not very sensitive or specific for carpal tunnel syndrome → hence is always performed in conjunction with other tests and investigations.
