# Inability to speak properly due to a disorder of central language processing, not of motor innnervation (dysarthria) or sensory input (deafness)

## Classification -> by fluency, comprehension,  repitition 
### Listen to the spontaneous speech -> Is the speech fluent?
#### Non-fluency -> somehow broken up speech 
##### sparse output -> reduced words per minute, shortened phrases
##### [[Agrammatisim]] -> missing function words (filler words) -> produces telegraphic speech
##### Effortfulness
#### If you suspect wernicke's aphasia -> show vast improvement when asking for movements when they are communicated with non-verbal cues 
### Naming objects and colours
### Comprehension 
### Repitition 
### Read and write
## Boston classification:
### Sudden onset: 
### Production deficit (including repitition) -> [[Broca's aphasia]]
### Understanding deficit (Including repitition) -> [[Wernicke's aphasia]]
### Isolated language repitition deficit -> [[Conduction aphasia]]
### Production deficit w/ spared repitition -> [[Transcortical motor aphasia]]
### Understanding deficit w/ spared repitition -> [[Transcortical sensory aphasia]]
### Isolated naming deficit -> [[Anomia]]
### ALL TOGETHER -> [[Global aphasia]]

## Additional syndromes:
### [[Subcortical motor aphasia]]
### [[Subcortical auditory aphasia]]
### [[Alexia without agraphia|Subcortical visual aphasia]]

## Several features of recovery specific for multi-linguals
### Pitre's law -> Recovery greatest in the language used the msot
### Ribot's rule -> Recovery is greatest for the mother tongue/native language
