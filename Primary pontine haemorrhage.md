# A type of CNS intraparenchymal haemorrhage occuring secondary to lipohyalinosis of the penetrating paramedian pontine arteries 
## Classical features:
### Presentation with [[Thunderclap headache]] and rapidly becomes unconscious
### Immediate spastic [[Quadriparesis]] with [[Hyper-reflexia]] and bilateral [[Bilateral Pinpoint pupils]]
#### There is no transient 'shock' stage with flaccidity like cortical strokes
### May have [[Decerebrate]] posturing and [[Cheyne-Stokes breathing]]
## Part of:
### [[Pontine haemorrhage]]
## DDx:
### Chronic longstanding [[Hypertension]]
## Complications
### Massive haemorrhage 
#### Above the pontine reticular formation -> [[Decerebrate|Decerebrate posturing]]
#### 4th ventricle compression -> [[Obstructive hydrocephalus]]

Lipohyalinosis as a result of poorly-controlled hypertension renders the vessel wall prone to rupture
- The larger paramedian perforators are more commonly the culprit vessels
