# Constellation of signs accompanying glomerulopathies which cause inflammatory rupture of the glomerulus through into the urinary space

## Includes:
### [[Frothy urine]], [[Haematuria]]  often described to be tea or [[Cocacola urine]]
### [[Hypertension]] -> [[Hypertensive headache]]
### if oedema -> only a mild [[Ascending pitting oedema]]
### if fulminant (↓ GFR) -> [[Oliguria]] and [[Uraemic syndrome]]

## DDx:
### Peads -> [[Alport's syndrome]], [[IgA Nephropathy]], [[IgA vasculitis]]
### young asian female -> [[Lupus nephritis]] from SLE
### older caucasian male -> [[ANCA associated vasculitides]]
### Secondary to infection -> Infectious endocarditis associated glomerulonephritis
### Recent strep-throat
#### Occur during or at the end of strep-throat episode -> [[IgA Nephropathy]]
#### Occuring 2-4 weeks after the end of a strep-throat episode -> [[Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis]]

Mechanism: Immune complex deposition/formation in the gelomerulus → inflammatory infiltrate → glomerular basement membrane rupture → loss of renally excreted RBCs (dismorphic RBCs) and ↓ GFR → hematuria, oliguria, azotemia, and ↑ renin → edema and hypertension
