# Group of signs which will occur after lesioning of the UMN to the relevant set of LMNs
### Includes: 
### [[Babinsksi's sign]], [[Clonus]], [[Spasticity]], [[Hyper-reflexia]], [[Hoffman's sign]], [[Pronator drift]] [[Hemiplegic gait]] and associated [[Pyramidal stance]], [[Weakness]]

### Part of:
### [[Spastic paraparesis]]

---

Mechanism: Destruction of inhibitory descending corticospinal input results in uninhibited LMN somatic and autonomic output to the peripheral  effectors
- #M1 -> #posterior_limb_of_internal_capsule -> #cerebral_peduncle -> #medullary_pyramid -> #pyramidal_decussation -> #corticospinal_tract in #lateral_funiculus

Seen in: #Neuro CNS movement disorder, Ischaemia, Trauma

When either weakness (or hypotonia if onset was recent) is detected on limb neuro exam, it is important to differentiate between an UMN cause and LMN cause of weakness.
