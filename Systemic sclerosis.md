# Systemic autoimmune disease of collagen deposition and fibrosis under [[Connective tissue diseases]]
## Clinical features:
### Early features are invariably [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] which preceed dermatological signs by  ~ 1 year
#### Systemic sclerosis occurs all over the body while CREST has limited dermatological manifestation up to the elbows and knees -> both types can involve the face 
#### Limited variant can be strangely associated with isolated [[Pulmonary hypertension]]
### [[Arthralgia]] and [[Myalgia]] are common presentations
### Dermatological features -> [[Salt and pepper skin]]

### Hand and face skin fibrosis -> [[Sclerodactyly]], [[Oro-facial fibrosis]]
### Diffuse systemic sclerosis implies -> dermatological and visceral involvement
#### Lung -> [[Pulmonary hypertension]] AND Interstitial pneumonia type [[Interstitial lung disease|ILD]] 
#### Cardiac fibrosis
#### GIT -> [[GORD]] from fibrosis and dilatation of lower oesophgeal sphincter
#### Renal -> mild microscopic haematuria or proteinuria -> severe and life-threatening [[Scleroderma renal crisis]] (which paradoxically occurs **early** in disease)

## DDx:
### Environmental exposure
### Drug induced -> [[Bleomycin]], [[L-tryptophan]]
### #Neoplasm -> secondary paraneoplastic syndrome from -> malignancy of breast, uterus, or lung   
## Mimics:
### Other scleroderma subtypes -> [[Limited systemic sclerosis]] and [[Juvenile systemic sclerosis]]
## Workup:
### Consistent clinical picture should get Nail fold capillaroscopy

### Routine labs will not reveal an inflammatory picture
### There are supportive antibody serologies which segregate limited from diffuse disease: 
#### ANA antibodies are positive for autoimmune disease and will rule systemic sclerosis out
#### Anti-topoisomerase antibodies are specific for systemic sclerosis (BUT NOT CREST)
#### Anti-centromere antibodies are specific for limited sclerosis (BUT NOT DIFFUSE)
### Imaging or visualisation of visceral organ fibrosis

# Tx
## Symptomatic treatment depends on the clinical features
### Skin fibrosis -> [[Methotrexate|MTX]], [[Mycophenolate]]
### Raynaud's -> [[vascular specific CCBs]]
### Arthralgia and myalgia -> [[NSAIDs]] -> if severe, **low dose** corticosteroids
#### High dose corticosteroids will worsen hypertension and precipitate SRC
### Lung fibrosis -> [[Mycophenolate]]
### Pulmonary hypertension -> Endothelin-1 receptor blocker
### Renal crisis -> [[ACE inhibitors]] or [[ARBs]]
### GORD -> [[PPI]]
---
## Complications
### [[Breast cancer]] -> regular Mammograms

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### Small vessel endothelial cell damage and chronic fibrosis -> microischaemia
