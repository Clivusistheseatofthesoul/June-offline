## Clinical features:
### More obvious than hypomagnesaemia because onset is oftentimes more abrupt
#### [[Bradycardia]] -> [[Conduction abnormalities|Heart blocks]] -> [[Hypotension]]
#### Generalised neuro findings
##### Generalised [[Generalised Hypo-reflexia|reduced reflexes]] and generalised weakness -> [[Quadriparesis]]
##### Parasympathetic blockade -> [[Dry mouth]], Bilaterally dilated pupils, [[Acute urinary retention]]
## DDx:
### [[Chronic kidney disease]]
### Excessive iatrogenic Mg2+ infusion
#### Mg enemas
#### Excessive infusion during Tx of [[Eclampsia]]
### Diseases
#### [[Tumor lysis syndrome]]

# Tx
## Elimination of Mg depends on the kidney function
| Renal function                  | Tx                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Normal or mild CKD              | Stop causative medication/Mg infusion |
| CKD with 15 < GFR < 45          | IV saline and [[Furosemide]]          |
| CKD with GFR < 15 OR Anuric AKI | Dialysis                              |
