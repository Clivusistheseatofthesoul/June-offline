Aliases: Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, Chronic AFib, Persistent AFib, Permenant AFib 
---
# 
## Clinical features:
### Typically just asymptomatic -> sometimes get palpitations
### More rarely -> can get ischaemic symptoms -> [[Acute chest pain]]
### In an acute episode of [[Acute AFib]] -> get variable pulse with variable 1st heart sound
## Classification: 
### Classifyied by duration of periods of fibrillation
#### Paroxysmal Afib
##### Fibrillation which self-terminates within 7 days
##### Typically caused by a few ectopic foci around the pulmonary veins
#### Persistent Afib
##### Fibrillation which lasts > 7 days 
##### Typically due to recurrent insult and progression from 'Lone AF' -> can attempt rhythm control
#### Permenant Afib
##### Fibrillation is constant
##### Due to non-reversible insult to the heart -> so just stick to rate control
##### Most often precipitated by comorbid cardiac and respiratory disease -> [[Coronary artery disease|CAD]], [[Chronic Heart failure]], [[Pulmonary hypertension]], [[Obstructive sleep apnoea|OSA]]
## DDx:
### Cardiogenic triggers
#### [[Coronary artery disease]], [[Valvular heart diseases]] causing distention of the L atria -> [[Mitral stenosis]] and [[Mitral regurgitation]] 
### Non-cardiogenic triggers (less common)
#### [[Obstructive sleep apnoea|OSA]], [[Thyrotoxicosis]], [[Alcohol intoxication]], [[Pneumonia]]

## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Diagnosed by ECG
![[Pasted image 20210224235304.png]]
#### Fine baseline fibrillations
#### lack of P waves
#### Irregularly irregular rhythm of QRS complexes
#### If HR is > 120 BPM -> Immediately start Mx for [[Acute AFib#Tx of Symptomatic AFib|AFib with RVR]]
### Aetiology workup
#### EUC -> K+ and Mg2+ 
#### Cardiac enzymes esp. troponins
#### endocrine screen -> just TSH is okay
#### TTE -> structural abnormality

# Tx
## Treat any reversible causes
### Infection -> [[Pneumonia]]
### Metabolic -> [[Thyrotoxicosis]], [[Alcohol intoxication]]
### Electrolytes -> K+ and Mg2+
## Do I rate control or do I rhythm control/[[cardiovert]]
### Assess likelihood of benefit with eventual cardioversion 
#### If either: Old, structurally diseased heart, coronary artery disease, lots of comorbidities -> do not cardiovert -> just stick to rate control
##### PO Diltiazem 30mg q6hrs
##### PO metoprolol
#### **If: Young**, and healthy heart structurally, no CAD, not alot of comorbidities -> ** cardiovert/rhythm control**
1. Anticoagulate for 3 weeks
2. Before TOE-cardioversion (either pharmacological or electrical)
3. Further anticoagulate for 1 month
The process is so laborious because of the risk of chronic AFib -> blood stasis in LAA -> cardioembolic [[Ischaemic stroke]]
## Get rid of the bad rhythm -> Rhythm control/cardioversion choices: 
### Amiodarone if existing heart disease
### Flecainide if no existing heart disease
### Consider surgical ablation if paroxysmal AFib
## Assess for aetiology to inform chronic anticoagulation 
### Valvular vs non-valvular AFib informs chronic anti-coagulation choice -> TTE
#### If valvular AFib -> Stick with Warfarin with LMWH bridge
##### Establised MS, RHD, or mechanical valve
#### If Non-valvular AFib -> feel free to use DOAC
## Give anticoagulation?
### Perform CHADS2-VASC score 
#### Score of 2 or more -> always give anti-coagulation
### If acutely ill and likely needs to do future procedures -> heparin
### Otherwise chronic anticoagulation: DOAC > Warfarin -> need to wait for TTE 
#### Warfarin esp. dangerous in those with -> other bleeding problems, hypertension (risk of ICH), Hx of falls
#### Use Warfarin only in those with
##### with mechanical valves OR mod/severe mitral stenosis OR ESKD

## Prevent complications -> Chronic  anticoagulation
### Perform CHADS2-VASC score 
#### If score of 1 -> can choose either no prophylaxis, aspirin, or anti-coagulate
#### Score of 2 or more -> always give anti-coagulation
### Give anticoagulation only if acute and needs to do procedures -> heparin
### Otherwise chronic anticoagulation: DOAC > Warfarin -> need to wait for TTE 
#### Warfarin esp. dangerous in those with -> other bleeding problems, hypertension (risk of ICH), Hx of falls
#### Use Warfarin only in those with
##### with mechanical valves OR mod/severe mitral stenosis OR ESKD

## Complications
### Throw off clots -> [[Ischaemic stroke]]
#### More rarely can get [[Acute Ischaemic colitis]]
### Although mostly asymptomatic -> can sometimes entrain the ventricle to join along too! -> Rapid ventricular response -> [[Acute AFib]]
### Atrial dilatation -> [[Mitral regurgitation]]
