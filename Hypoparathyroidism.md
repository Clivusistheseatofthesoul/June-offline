## Clinical features:
###
## DDx:
### Generally almost always *Iatrogenic*
#### Typically during thyroid resection -> accidentally taking out the PTH glands
#### Post-op from PTH resection -> primary [[Hyperparathyroidism]] which has caused all the other glands to be atrophied -> swing hypoparathyroidism while they recover
### Very rarely autoimmune
## Mimics:
### Post-op [[Hypocalcaemia]] typically on day 1
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Low serum [[Ca2+]] -> PO4+ is typically normal
#### Driven by low serum PTH
