# Frank ascites can be seen from the bedside, Shifting dullness can detect lower limit of 2L
## Description
### Abnormal buldging flanks (Convex contour of abdomen)
#### In obesity the anterior and posterior sides recieves equal amounts of adipose deposition
#### Ascitic distension only occurs anteriorly -> **make sure to check them standing**
### On exam
#### [[Shifting dullness]]
## Part of:
### [[Hypervolaemia]], [[Nephrotic syndrome]]

## DDx: if SAAG > 11g/L -> Cirrhotic ascites (transudate from pressure)
### [[CCF]] and causes of [[Right heart failure]] -> [[]]
### [[Chronic liver disease]] causing cirrhosis
### Physical obstruction from [[Budd Chiari syndrome]]

## DDx: if SAAg < 11g/L -> Non-cirrhotic ascites (exudate from osmosis )
### causes of [[Hypoalbuminaemia]] -> [[Nephrotic syndrome]], [[protein losing enteropathy]]
### causes of increased peritoneal vessel permeability
### Paraneoplastic -> [[Peritoneal carcinomatosis]]
### Inflammatory -> [[tubercuous peritonitis]], [[Chronic pancreatitis]]

## Complications
### Infection -> [[Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]]

---
Mechanism: two main causative mechanisms of ascites: cirrhotic and noncirrhotic ascites
- Cirrhotic ascites is caused by raised intraluminal pressure pushing the fluid into the third space
	- **High portal vein pressure** -> Backlog of pressure secondary to RHS heart failure   OR raised intrahepatic pressure from hyperdynamic circulation -> force **transudate fluid** out from peritoneal vessels to third space into the peritoneum 
- Non-cirrhotic ascites is caused by active transport of osmotic substances into peritoenum OR change in oncotic pressure gradient -> causing osmotic third spacing
	- **Loss of osmotic pull** -> reduced vessel oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminaemia -> drives **exudate fluid** out into the third space
