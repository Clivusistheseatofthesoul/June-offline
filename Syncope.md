# Blackout or fainting spell defined as: transient loss of consciousness, postural tone 
## Includes:
### Abrupt transient and complete loss of consciousness
### [[Loss of postural tone]] -> fainting, or slumping if in chair
### Short duration < 5min out  with rapid spontaneous recovery -> confusion/drowsiness lasts < 5 min 
### Sometimes there is a prodrome ->  Feeling faint, knowing you are going to black-out


---
# Approach
## History + collateral Hx
### Actions immediately before, any known triggers
#### Typically standing in a claustrophobic crowded environment, painful stimuli
#### **Post-exercise is reflex syncope, during exercise is cardiogenic syncope!**
### Symptoms immediately before
#### Nausea, hyperhydrosis, feeling of something is wrong 
### Did you blackout or were you awake?
### Injury during the fall
### Duration of blackout
#### If ≥ 5 mins -> unlikely syncope
##### Consider -> [[Drug induced sedation]], [[Narcolepsy]], Intoxication E.g [[Alcohol intoxication]], [[Excessive daytime sleepiness|Hypersomnolence]]
### If still confused: look for associated features

### Exam includes:
### [[Orthostatic hypotension]], [[Carotid sinus massage]] if age > 40 y/o
## If:
### FND -> CT head
### Asymptomatic head trauma during episode -> watch closely + consider CT head
### exam findings + signfiicant CVD risk factors -> Echo and/or cardiac enzymes
### If anything strange on the ECG -> inpatient telemetry -> if still nothing then heartbug or loop recorder
## DDx: 3 aetiology groups
### **VV** -> Reflex syncope -> secondary to exxagerated ANS response to normal stimuli -> sometimes together called vasovagal
#### [[Vasovagal syncope]] -> Event causing emotional overload into CNS
#### [[Situational syncope]] -> overstimulation from visceral organ activity 
##### Cough, sneeze, Post-micturition, Post=prandial
#### [[Carotid sinus hypersensitivity]] -> overstimulation of the carotid sinus
### **O** -> Orthostatic syncope -> defined by [[Orthostatic hypotension]] with blackout 
#### [[Hypovolaemia]] -> reduced venous return which can't be compensated by baroreceptor reflex
#### Med side effects -> Any [[Anti-Hypertensive]] but also including [[Alpha-blockers]], [[Anti-depressants]], [[Anti-psychotics]] -> **look out for polypharmacy in the elderly patient**
#### [[Autonomic failure]]
### **M and A** -> Cardiogenic syncope: Arrhythmias and mechanical causes -> the deadly one!
#### Tachyarrhythmias -> [[VT]], SVTs are more likely to cause palpitations and presyncope only
#### Bradyarrhythmias -> [[Sinus bradycardia]], [[Sinus pauses]], [[AV blocks]]
#### Mechanical obstruction -> [[Aortic stenosis]], [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies]], Massive [[Pulmonary embolism|PE]]

### **N** -> 'Neurogenic' syncope -> very rare, only consider if everything r/o
#### [[Vertebrobasilar insufficiency]], [[Subclavian steal syndrome]]

### **P** -> Psychogenic pseudosyncope -> Face-palm maneuver
### **E** -> Electrolyte disturbance

## Mimics:
### Other causes of sudden loss of consciousness -> generalised seizures, Status epilepticus, 
### Visual blackout -> visual defects
### Medication side effects -> [[Drug induced sedation]]
### Alcohol blackout -> [[Alcohol intoxication]]
### Vertigo -> see [[Suspected Vertigo]]
