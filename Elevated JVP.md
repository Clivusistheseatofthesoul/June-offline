# > 4 cm perpendicular above the jugular notch
## Description
### Mild JVP elevation which cannot be seen visually =can be brought about through the abdominojugular reflex (previously hepatojugular reflex)
## Part of:
### [[Hypervolaemia]], [[SVC syndrome]]
## DDx:
### Cardiac causes -> [[Right heart failure]] or [[CCF]]
#### [[Pericardial effusion|pericarditis]]
### Non-cardiac causes
#### [[Hypervolaemia]]
#### [[SVC syndrome]]

Mechanism: Backup of venous blood into the SVC

-   To determine if jugular venous distention is due to pressure from below or are simply prominent, use the method of "stripping" the vein
-   Place our adjacent forefingers over a distended segment of the external jugular vein
-   Strip the vein of its blood by moving your fingers apart while maintaining firm pressure on the vein (the vein should be flat as you maintain pressure on it)
-   To test for "filling from below" (from the heart back up into the veins), release only the finger closest to the heart (keep the other finger in its place)
-   If the central venous pressure is high enough, the vein will fill in a retrograde fashion ("from below")
