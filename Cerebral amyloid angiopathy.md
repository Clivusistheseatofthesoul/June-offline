# Amyloid deposition into the cerebral superificial vessels resulting in multiple lobar intraparenchymal haemorrhages
## Clinical features:
### Presents as focal neurologic deficits localising to lobes with potential mass effect
#### Often precipitated by anti-platelet agent E.g [[Aspirin]] -> which increases only the size of bleeds
### Typically [[Lobar haemorrhage]] and [[Cerebellar haemorrhage]]
## DDx:
###
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### SWI-MRI 
#### reveals amyloid deposition within microvasculature + diffuse haemosiderin deposition across the cortex
