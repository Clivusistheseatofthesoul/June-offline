# Characteristic pattern of ataxia produced by marked loss in proprioceptive afferents to the cerebrum
## Includes:
### UL isolated -> Canno't touch nose with eyes closed, Finger nose [[Dysmetria]]
### LL and generalised involvement -> [[Romberg's sign]], [[Pseudoathetosis]]
### Gait can be normal unless there is additional involvement or their eyes are closed
## DDx: loss of ascending proprioceptive cerebellar input
### Posterior cord syndromes -> [[Tabes dorsalis]], [[Subacute combined degeneration of the cord]]
### CNS demyelination -> typically [[NMOSD]]
### Genetic -> [[Freidreich's ataxia]]

Mechanism: destructive lesion of proprioceptive afferents into the cerebellum through the ICP
- coordination impairment of motor actions with loss of joint position is typically compensated by visual cues â†’ gait ataxia thats typically compensated then suddenly revealled with eye closure (Romberg's sign)

Sensory ataxia is impaired coordination as a result of a destructive lesion to the pathways carrying proprioceptive information to the thalamus/cerebrum (dorsal column tracts)

- Compare to [Cerebellar ataxia](Cerebellar%20ataxia%2058f38f774e3d4d52be815178023cbaf2.md) which is due to destructive lesioning of the cerebellum and its efferents.
- Compare to [Vestibular ataxia](Vestibular%20ataxia%20179aa9f27f2b4eb3ada5086c0a870df8.md) which is due to destructive lesioning of the vestibular pathways
