# Innoculation and infection of a [[Pneumonia|parapneumonic]] [[Pleural effusion|pleural effusion]] 
## Clinical features:
### Recent pneumonia with new [[Pleuritic chest pain]]
### Generalised systemic signs -> [[Fever]], [[Chills, rigors]] despite adequate abx therapy
### Auscultation showing
#### Region of unilateral [[Reduced breath sounds]] near old pneumonia
#### [[Reduced vocal fremitis]]
#### [[Stoney dull percussion]]
## DDx:
### [[S. pneumoniae]] and [[S. aureus]] most common 
### Secondary to [[Hepatic hydrothorax]]
## Mimics:
### If no systemic infection signs -> could just be another cause of pleural effusion -> **do not tap right away!!!** -> see [[Pleural effusion#^6e6419|pleural effusion workup]]
## Workup:
### lat decubital CXR
#### Initial gathering of fluid once > 250mL will blunt the costophrenic angle
#### Fluid level with meniscus is indicative of some form of fluid gathering in the pleural space
##### Could still be haemothorax, chylothorax or just an effusion 
### Thoracentesis and tap the fluid	-> culture positive for infection 
#### Pleural fluid analysis to determine type of fluid
##### Transudate (water) -> drives fluid across using hydrostatic or oncotic pressure 
##### Exudate (cellular) -> drives fluid across using reduced microvascular permeabiltiy

# Tx
## Abx therapy is first line
## Failure to respond or very large/loculated empyema require surgical drainage
### Chest drain + intrapleural enzyme therapy like dornase alfa and alteplase
