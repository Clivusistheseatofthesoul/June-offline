**Mechanism:** Destructive lesion of bottom-up imaging forming pathway with sparing of the retina -> #non-dominant and #dominant #V1 -> **without extension** into the dorsal stream visual association areas
- Most commonly this is due to #bilateral #PCA -> #calcarine_artery ischaemic infarcts

**Seen in:** #Neuro, #Ischaemia
