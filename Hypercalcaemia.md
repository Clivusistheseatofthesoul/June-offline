# Hypercalcaemia
## Clinical features:
### [[Nephrolithiasis|Kidney stones]]
### [[Altered mental status|Psychic moans]] and oftentimes -> [[Psychosis]]
### [[Abdominal pain|Abdominal groans]]
### [[Bone pain|Painful bones]]
### Chronic hypercalcaemia can produce:
#### [[Proximal muscle weakness]] with generalised [[Hyper-reflexia]], [[Calcinosis cutis]]

## DDx:
### MASSIVE elevations:
#### [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
#### [[Hypercalcaemia of malignancy]]
#### [[Hypervitaminosis D]]
### Small elevations:
#### [[Hypercalcaemia of immobilisation]]
#### [[FHH]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Bedside
#### ECG
##### [[QT interval shortening]]
### Labs
#### If elevated on labs and they are symptomatic -> directly treat
#### If asymptomatic -> recheck Ca2+ -> if still elevated on recheck -> then treat
#### serum PTH, vitamin D (specific)

# Tx
## The solution to pollution is dilution -> IV Fluids
## Start Long term calcium reduction early
### Early Bisphosphonates
## Immediate calcium reduction also if very severe 
### Calcitonin -> Calci*tone-down*

Hypercalcaemia is caused by dysregulation of mineral homeostasis resulting in elevated serum [Ca2+]. The most common cause of this is [[Chronic kidney disease]] -> PO4- retention -> secondary [[Hyperparathyroidism]] -> Hypercalcaemia 
- Without something to support Ca2+ deposition into the bone -> can get bone disease due to reduced or increased bone turnover  E.g [[Renal bone disease]]
