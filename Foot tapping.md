# [[Dysdiadochokinesia|Dysdiadochokinesis]] of the lower limb
## DDx:
### Cerebellar lesion OR isolated lesion to midbrain can produce isolated foot tapping deficit

---
Mechanism: Mechanism: Lesions towards the #cerebellum/spinocerebellum and #cerebellum/cerebrocerebellum  → destruction of centres calculating coordination of complex movement in the distal extremities → delays in motor initiation + delays in termination + abnormalities in force and acceleration calculations → quickly exacerbating the changes seen in dysmetria → dysdiadochokinesia
- Isolated foot inability to foot tap -> #Midbrain/inferior_midbrain/pedunculopontine_nucleus_pars_compacta
