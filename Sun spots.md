# Asymptomatic flaky or **scaley**, hypopigmented patches which are sharply demarcated
## DDx:
### Caused by -> [[Malassezia furfur]]

## Mimics:
### Bigger depigmentations which grow bigger progressively over the course of years -> Vitiligo
#### Small lesions can coalesce to produce large depigmented lesions but would have irregular borders with multiple surrounding satellite lesions in the case of pityriasis versicolor

Mechanism: Yeast produces azelaic acid, which diffuses down and impairs the function of the melanocytes
Seen in: #Skin #infection

Typically harmless infection which requires minimal intervention -> skin sheds faster than the fungus invades the superficial layer
