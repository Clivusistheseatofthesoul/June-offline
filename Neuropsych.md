You are only allowed to administer specific tests:
- NO IQ tests
- NO speech tests

## Neuroanat
neocortical temporal most of it is auditory and language
lesions produce word finding and anomia 
- left: verbal
- right: visual, landmarks, spatial and nonverbal reasoning

MTL -> declariative memory
- left: verbal again
- right: visual or non verbal (routes and spatial nav)

parietal: visuospatial breakdown  
- prosopagnosia
- apraxia
- hemineglect syndromes

frontal
- PMA and SMA: learned action sequences 

Prefrontal
- dfPFC: executive functioning, intergration of online cognition
	- memory encoding and retrieval
	- attentional deficit and WM deficit
	- executive
		- planning and organisation of steps
		- generativity of ideas 
		- flexibility (in ability to solve problems -> essential to ability to solve metaphors) extreme version of impaired flexibility is perseveration 
- OFC: stopping
	- impulsive disinhibitive, emotional lability , low fustration tolerance
- ACC: starting 
	- problems with initiate goal directed actions
	- inconsistent effort, reduced spontaneity , psychomotor retardation 

Memory is distributed:
- encoding and learning requires frontal lobe processes
- encoding into storage requires hipp
- retrieval is a frontal lobe process 

If cues required -> only recognition memory intact -> frontal not MTL lesion 

ACute delirium like Encephalitis:

Psychosis:
- cognitive impairment is a negative feature of psychosis 
- impairment diffuse often including executive and memory 

neurodevelopmental:
- ASd and ADHD also included because of reduced baseline (2SD at least)

## Attention and orientation tested first 
- perform test when they are best 

## 5 words
## Clockface is sensitive to alot of visuospatial and numerical deficits
Does not load on memory at all
- draw clockface with numbers
- 10 past 5 
Qualitative analysis of deficit pattern is best 

RHS hemisphere lesions: disorganised clocks + extrahands hands not standardised distances 

stimulus bound patients: hands will be at 10 and 5 or draw actual clocks or perseverative (filled with 20 numbers, nill planning just filling in the space)

## Verbal fluency 
Take note of the errors throughout
- always do for full minute (if sharp dropoff ACC lesion)
### Word generation 
#### From letter: not include proper nouns, same words with same ending
- include mythological animals and extinct animals because they are concepts
- frontal lobe deficit (bvFTD)
#### From category: 
- use animals, fruits, veges:
	- count subordinates but not supraordinate category E.g not dog only labrador  
- more on semantic memory and anomia -> left hemisphere temporal (PPA, AD and SD)
### letter fluency or phonemic fluency
### 

## Reasoning
### similarity between words
#### Verbal concept formation 
Concreteness: just describe item or respond to answer relating only to one item; using on the of items as an answer 
Perseveration: giving the same answer over an over again 
### Proverbs
If they havent heard it before -> good -> relying more on abstraction less on LTM 

## Premorbid functioning
Measured by 'hold tasks'
- word knowledge and vocab
- if they ask to google -> tick off for stratergy use 

ACE + FES will cover everything 
KICA for indigenous populations

- impairment diffuse often including executive and memory 

neurodevelopmental:
- ASd and ADHD also included because of reduced baseline (2SD at least)

## Attention and orientation tested first 
- perform test when they are best 

## Test for memory 
### 5 words or 3 objects-words


Executive function can be screened through clockface and word similarity 
## Clockface is sensitive to alot of visuospatial and numerical deficits
Does not load on memory at all
- draw clockface with numbers
- 10 past 5
