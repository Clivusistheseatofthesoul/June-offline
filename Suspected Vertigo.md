# Feeling of the room spinning around and around → isolated [[Oscillopsia]]
## Includes:
### [[Central Vertigo]] and [[Peripheral Vertigo]]
### Identifying features -> [[Oscillopsia]], [[Tilt illusion]], [[Drop attacks]]
## Approach: 
### Patient presentation is often with 'dizzyness' -> Eliminate vertigo mimics
#### Presyncope -> syncope is feeling faint, lightheaded and then blacking out
#### Dysequilibrium -> unable to stay balanced, worse when trying to walk
#### Vertigo is movement when head and eyes are kept stationary + unique symptoms:
#### [[Tilt illusion]], [[Drop attacks]]
#### Seizures -> Lateral tongue bite, Post-fall confusion > 5 mins, Sx of seizures, Sx of raised ICP
### Trigger -> specifically:
#### Absent at rest and triggered only by movement of head
#### Secondary to head trauma 
#### Secondary to straining (coughing, defecation, lifting weights)
### Timecourse -> duration and pattern

#### Recurrent episodes lasting seconds-min
##### onset with movement -> [[BPPV]] -> perform Dix hallpike
##### trauma to ear/scuba diving -> [[Perilymphatic fistula]]
#### Recurrent episodes lasting min-hours
##### Onset with headache + photophobia + constant lasting days -> [[Vestibular migraine]]
##### Has episodic tinnitus or sensorineural hearing loss -> [[Menniere's disease]]
#### Constant vertigo -> likely central vertigo
##### If single constant episode lasting 1 day with post-infectious onset (typically viral illness) -> [[Vestibular neuritis]]
### Associated symptoms:
#### Prescence of imbalance >> vertigo -> bilateral insult 
#### Tinnitus + hearing loss -> [[Menniere's disease]]
#### Headache + photophobia -> [[Vestibular migraine]]
#### Eye pain and redness -> [[Cogan's syndrome]]
#### Other focal neurologic signs on exam -> MRI ± MRA for strokes and CNS demyelination 
## HINTS exam if continuous vertigo:
### If Central vertigo likely -> MRI ± MRA
## Complete neuro exam and ear exam
### Other neurologic signs -> MRI ± MRA
## Dix hallpike maneuver only if episodic vertigo attacks 
### Dix can Dx only posterior semicircular canal otoliths (most common) so can potentially be a false -ve for BPPV

**Mechanism:** Asymmetrical central or peripheral insult to the vestibular pathways -> #ipsilateral destructive lesion 

**Seen in:** #Neuro #peripheral_nerve
