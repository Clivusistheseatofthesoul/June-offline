# Overt shock is defined as Systolic BP > 90; or if in ICU -> MAP < 65
## Factors contributing to BP:
	MAP = CO x TPR
	
	MAP = (HR x VR x contractility) x (TPR)
	
	MAP = (systolic "umph") x (diastolic "tone")
	
## Pitfalls: missing an occult shock or failing to admit patient with a portsmouth sign
### Occult shock is a seemingly norma blood pressure in someone who is previously floridly hypertensive 
### [[Portsmouth sign]]

## Classification:
### Causes of loss of systolic 'umph' -> [[Cold and clammy]] + [[Narrow pulse pressure]], [[Delayed capillary refill]]
#### Severe enough tachycardia or bradycardia -> [[Cardiogenic shock]]
#### [[Hypovolaemia]] -> [[Hypovolaemic shock]]
#### Reduced venous return -> either RHS or LHS -> all [[Obstructive shock]]
##### RHS preload obstruction -> [[Tension pneumothorax]], [[Acute cardiac tamponade]]
##### LHS preload obstruction -> [[Pulmonary embolism]] [[Pulmonary hypertension]]
#### Impaired contractility -> [[Cardiogenic shock]]
##### [[Myocardial infarction]], [[Acute heart failure]] and chronic [[CCF]], Trauma [[Cardiac contusion]]
### Causes of loss of diastolic 'tone' -> [[Warm forearm and leg]] + [[Wide pulse pressure]] -> aka 'Distributive shock'
#### [[Sepsis]], [[Anaphylaxis]]
#### [[Adrenal crisis|Addisonian crisis]] and "whiplash" from [[Phaeochromocytoma]]
#### [[Spinal cord injury]], [[Anaesthesia]]
