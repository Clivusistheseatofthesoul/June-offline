# Involuntary, non-rhythmic flickers of small muscle group activity (fasicles) -> often described as vermicular or like a 'bag-of-worms'
## Part of:
### [[LMN signs]], [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
## DDx:
### When found in conjunction with generalised UMN signs -> [[MND]] 
### Isolated LMN signs with prominent fasicuclations -> [[Spinal muscular atrophy]], [[Poliomyelitis]]
### Spider bite -> [[Funnel web spider]]
### Toxicity -> [[Cholinergic toxicity]]
## Mimics:
### Undulations and slower movements -> Myokymia

Mechanism: → spontaneous activation of LMNs → recruitment of singular motor unit fibres without concurrent activation of surrouding motor units

Fasciculations are commonly classified as a **LMN sign**. However it can also commonly be caused by benign causes (benign fasciculations from E.g Caffiene, stress, excrecise) or other non-localisable insults like Cholinergic toxicity and Funnel-web spider bites.

- Occurance with recent painful bite mark → Funnel-web spider bite → Robustotoxin → random alpha-motor neuron activation
- isolated fasciculations of the resting tongue with no peripheral sensory features on examination → strongly suggestive of MND
