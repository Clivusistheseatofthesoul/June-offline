# Paleness, Typically found at the palmar creases and the conjunctiva -> but can occur in an entire limb
## Part of:
### If in limb -> [[Compartment syndrome]]
## DDx:
### [[Iron deficiency]]
### Acute blood loss -> [[Hypovolaemic shock]]

---
**Mechanism:** Vasoconstriction of peripheral dermal structures to redivert blood to critical organs due to chronic reduction in haematocrit
**Seen in:** #eyes  #Mouth #Skin

Paleness can most easily be detected on the palmar creases (if they do not have pigmented palmar creases) and under the lower eyelid:

- The lower eyelid should generally have a paler inner section and a blush outer section → this is lost in conjunctival pallor

- Loss of colour in the palmar creases either with or without wiping the thumb over the surface of the creases is also an indication for pallor → this only works in people with non-pigmented palmar creases
