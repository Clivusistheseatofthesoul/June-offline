# Constellation of signs occuring as a result of raised ICP causing herniation of the cingulate gyrus across and underneath the falx cerebri

## Includes: 
### [[Obstructive hydrocephalus]] and [[Raised ICP headache]]
### Contralateral [[Crural hemiparesis]] 
### Herniation from non-dominant to dominant hemisphere -> [[Aphasias]]
## Part of:
### [[Raised ICP]] oftentimes due to lateral cerebral mass effect -> [[Acute Sub-dural haemorrhage]]

---
Mechanism: lateral mass effect secondary to bleed or mass lesion compressing contralateral hemisphere 
- Lateral ventricular outlet compression -> foramen of Munro obstruction -> obstructive hydrocephalus + ventriculomegaly resulting in headache
- Cingulate gyrus herniation underneath the falx -> ACA infarction occurs as the cingulate sulcus extends under the falx dragging the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery with it compressing it against the falx
