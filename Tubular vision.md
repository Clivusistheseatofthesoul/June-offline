This is probably the most frequent simulated field defect

## Case
A 12-year-old girl claimed visual difficulty and was shown to have such a field defect. The patient's parents were unwilling to accept a non-organic explanation in spite of more extens- ive investigations than were justified by the signs, and all tests were normal. After some acrimonious discussion and denial that there could be any possible background stresses the child was taken for a second opinion. One year later an enquiry of her general practitioner revealed that the child had eventually admitted a sexual assault by a relative.
