Aliases: lateral pontine syndrome, 
---
# Set of signs which accompany infarction of the lateral pons due to occlusion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery
## Includes:
### [[Central Vertigo]] + ipsilateral [[Sensorineural deafness]]
### Ipsilateral limb and gait ataxia -> fall towards side of lesion
### [[Ipsilateral face + Contralateral body distribution]] Hemisensory loss for all domains in the face but only pain/temperature for the body 
### **Differentiating factor with [[Wallenberg Syndrome|PICA syndrome]] -> **[[Ipsilateral face weakness]] + ipsilateral [[Corneal reflex (absent)]]** + loss of taste anterior 2/3 tongue
### Other:
#### Ipsilateral [[Horner's Syndrome]]

Mechanism:

	lateral spinothlamaic tract -> Contralateral loss of pain and temperature from the trunk and extremities.

	[Facial nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nucleus "Facial nucleus") & facial Nerve (CN.VII)

	**(1)** Ipsilateral paralysis of the upper and lower face ([lower motor neuron lesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_motor_neuron_lesion "Lower motor neuron lesion")). **(2)** Ipsilateral loss of [[Tearfulness|lacrimation]] and reduced salivation. **(3)** Ipsilateral loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. **(4)** Loss of corneal reflex (efferent limb).

	[Principal sensory trigeminal nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_sensory_trigeminal_nucleus "Principal sensory trigeminal nucleus") and tract

	Ipsilateral loss of all sensory modalities to the face (facial hemianesthesia)

	Vestibular Nuclei and intraaxial nerve fibers

	Nystagmus, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo

	Cochlear nuclei and intraaxial nerve fibers

	[Hearing loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss "Hearing loss") \- ipsilateral central deafness

	Middle & inferior cerebellar peduncle

	Ipsilateral limb and gait [ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia "Ataxia")

	Descending sympathetic tract

	Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, & anhydrosis)
