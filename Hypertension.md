Aliases: HTN

# Systolic blood pressure measurement of ≥130 mmHg or any diastolic blood pressure measurement of ≥80 mmHg
## Part of:
### [[Cushing's Triad]]
### (chronic) [[Hypervolaemia]]
### [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[Metabolic syndrome]]
### [[Acromegaly]]
## Includes:
### [[systolic hypertension]] or [[diastolic hypertension]]
### If >180/90 -> Severe hypertension -> [[Hypertensive urgency]] -> [[Hypertensive crisis]]

---
# Approach
## Look for red-flags of secondary hypertension 
### HTN in a healthy, non-overweight individual of age < 30 y/o without a FHx of hypertension
### Sudden hypertensive episodes with previously stable values
### End organ damage suggestive of episodes of [[Hypertensive crisis]]
### Treatment resistant hypertension: Non-responsive to 3 anti-HTNs (including a diuretic)
### The most common is renovascular HTN
#### Acute onset [[Pulmonary oedema]], an [[Abdominal bruit]] specifically systolic abdominal bruits
#### Unexplained reduction in GFR within 1 week of starting ACEi or ARB
#### Unexplained asymmetrical kidney size ≥1.5cm with an atrophic kidney

## DDx: 
### 'Primary' HTN -> [[Idiopathic hypertension]]
### 'Secondary' HTNs: **around 1/10 people will have a secondary cause**
### #endocrinology  -> [[Hyperaldosteronism]], [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[Phaeochromocytoma]]
### #cardio -> [[Coarctation of the aorta]] -> upper extremity limited BP elevation with brachio-femoral delay
### #renal -> causes of [[Nephritic syndrome]], [[Renovascular diseases]]
### #Neuro -> [[Primary pontine haemorrhage]]
### Systemic -> [[Obstructive sleep apnoea]]
### #pregnancy -> [[Gestational hypertension]]



# Tx
## All patients adopt lifestyle modification to reduce both BP and absolute CVD risk
### Diet -> DASH diet ± K+ supplementation (citrus fruits)
#### No K+ supplementation in renal failure and those on K+ sparing diuretics
### Excercise -> 30min/day for at least 2 hours each week 
### Stop drinking
## Weight reduction in those who are overweight -> 7/3 per 5kg lost
### If the BMI is > 25 you must lose weight 
## Manage other contributing risk diseases:
### [[Obstructive sleep apnoea|OSA]]
### Insulin resistance from [[T2DM]]
## Risk stratification determines degree of further intervention:

### In stage I hypertension -> if they have at least one major risk factor or have > 10% absolute risk of CVD on Framingham risk score -> one oral hypertensive 
#### Followup in 1 month -> are you taking it? Do you have any side effects? Should be titrate it higher?
### Typically start ACEi or vascular CCB
#### Start [[ACEi]] if
##### > 55 y/o or has [[T2DM]]
#### Start [[vascular specific CCBs]] if
##### > 55 y/o AND no [[T2DM]]
### If no control under monotherapy -> dual combination therapy
#### ACEi + CCb
#### ACEi/CCb + [[Thiazide diuretic]]
### If no control under dual therapy -> triple therapy
#### ACEi + CCb + Thiazide diuretic
### if no control under triple therapy -> **QUADRUPLE THERAPY**
#### If serum [K+] > 4.5 -> [[Beta blocker]] or [[Alpha-blockers]]
#### If serum [K+] < 4.5 -> [[Spironalectone|Potassium sparing diuretic]]
### if there is response rapidly under spironalectone -> suspect secondary cause
### If Comorbid conditions present, use these to determine the initial choice of the [[Anti-hypertensive]]

#### If no comorbid disease -> pick either [[ACE inhibitors]],[[vascular specific CCBs]] or [[Thiazide diuretic]]
#### If someone with previously resistant hypertension responds rapidly to spironalectone -> secondary hypertension, specifically primary [[Hyperaldosteronism]]

## Monitering
### Goal is to get BP in most individuals to < 120/80 (SPRINT trial)


---
## Complications
### [[Hypertensive urgency]] -> [[Hypertensive crisis]]

---
## Aetiology
### Hypertension is a renal disease, the heart is the perpetuator and the sufferer (in the end), but it is not the *cause* of HTN
