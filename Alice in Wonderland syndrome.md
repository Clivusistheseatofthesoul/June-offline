## Cases
A 65-year-old woman who suffered lifelong migraine with visual phenomena, reported her most frightening experience. An attack had started conventionally with flickering lights, but after 20 minutes, when the headache began, her vision remained abnormal and started to distort. All the verticals in the room seemed to undulate and the door frame appeared much narrower at the top than at the bottom. To her horror, when she put her arm out to stroke the dog, her arm appeared to be about 12 feet long, tapering to a very small hand that she could see patting her dog, which looked like a small porcelain figurine. This distortion of vision lasted a further 20 minutes before clearing.
