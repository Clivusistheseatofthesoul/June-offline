# Dysfunction in production of **meaningful skilled action** specifically that cannot be attributed to weakness, tremor, other primary sensorimotor deficit or generalized cognitive impairment
## Includes:
### [[Ideomotor apraxia]], [[Ideational apraxia]], [[Limb-kinetic apraxia]]

## Sometimes incorrectly used to refer to other disorders which have little to actually do with skilled action:
### Dressing apraxia, Oculomotor apraxia, constructional apraxia

**Mechanism:** destructional lesion to the ventrodorsal output pathways (comprising the [[frontoparietal ideomotor praxis network]]) from the dorsal stream -> DWMT -> **dominant lobe** frontal cortex (storage of praxis engrams) -> premotor cortex countralateral to the apraxic side

Apraxias are manifestations of higher order neuronal disruption -> hence sometimes seen in both hands despite being most commonly a #dominant hemisphere destructional lesion 
- technically there are only 2 classical desriptions of apraxia: ideamotor and ideational
	1. [[Ideomotor apraxia]] is inability to excute **meaningful skilled actions** in a single step movement 
		- this can be localisable to body parts:
			- hands (distal muscles)
			- trunk (proximal muscles)
			- face (orobuccal muscles)

	2. [[Ideational apraxia]] is inability to excute **meaningful skilled actions** only when a serial sequence of movements is required
		- this is not localisable to body parts -> generalised dysfunctions specific to a multistep task
