## Clinical features:
### Must have a combination of both upper and lower motor neuron signs
#### There are some characteristic clinical syndromes of MND: 
##### UMN + LMN to entire body [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]
##### UMN to entire body only -> [[Primary lateral sclerosis]]
##### LMN to entire body only -> [[Progressive muscle atrophy]]
##### Isolated UMN + LMN to cranial nerves only -> [[Progressive bulbar palsy]]
### There are never deficits in:
#### Sensory modalities
#### Bladder 
#### Ocular and extraocular muscles

# Tx
## [[Riluzole]] can slow motor deterioration in those with ALS -> prolongs survival typically by 3 months
## Sx treatment
### Bulbar palsy -> Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding
### dyspnoea -> Nocturnal nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)  
##  Supportive care
### nursing, social, end-of-life issues when disease is advanced
