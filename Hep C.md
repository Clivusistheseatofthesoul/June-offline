# Summary
-   Escherichia coli is a normal component of the gut flora
    -   Initially, overwhelming expansion can cause diarrhoea with O157:H7 EHEC causing severe, haemorrhaagic and watery diarrhoea + Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
    -   when given the opportunity for expansion it can invade into surrounding mucosal and epidermal surfaces causing → UTI, Ascending cholangitis → eventually to distant organs which are **life-threatening** → Neonatal meningitis
    -   HepC is a enveloped RNA virus with a single reading frame
		-   Does not intergrate into the genome of the host cell -> easier to eliminate and treat 
		-   There are 6 genotypes of the virus which have different geographical distribution 
		-   Australia has most Genotype 1 and genotype 3 
	
# Aetiology
## Spread
### [[IV drug use]] and high-risk sexual contact [[IV ]]
### Can occur with needlestick injury
## Pathogenicity

---
# Clinical manifestations
## Only causes [[Chronic hepatitis]] -> does not cause acute hepatitis
## [[Chronic hepatitis]] if not cleared -> [[Chronic liver disease]] [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]]
### rate of Chronic hepatitis progression is modified by [[Alcohol use disorder]], co-infection with [[HIV]], [[Hep B]]
## Also [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]
## potentially [[Coronary artery disease|CAD]] and [[Carotid artery stenosis]] 


---
# Dx
## IgM to diagnose current or recent infection
## IgG stays for life -> demonstrate previous infection 

---
# Tx 
## Eradication of the virus from the body (95% success rate)
### Protease, NS5A inhibitors, and Nucleotide analogues
#### 12 weeks for non-cirrhotics; 24 weeks for cirrhotics -> all oral meds!
## Primary prevention with HepA vaccine 
### Provide to
#### Household contacts of epidemic
#### Travellers to asia, african subcontinent and south america
