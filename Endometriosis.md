# Extra-uterine seeding of endometrial tissue 
## Clinical features:
### [[Dysmenorrhea]] or [[Chronic pelvic pain in a female]]
### Other associated Gynae Sx:
#### [[Dyspareunia]], [[Menorrhagia HMB|HMB]]
#### If left late -> [[Fixed immovable uterus]], [[Fixed retroverted uterus]], [[Massive abdominal masses]]
### Commonly results in [[Persistent chronic fatigue]]
### Risk is increased by:
#### Tendency for [[Menorrhagia HMB|Heavy menstrual bleeding]] and FHx of endometriosis
## DDx:
###
## Mimics:
###
## Workup:
### Bedside
### Imaging
####
### Labs are only for ruling out mimics

# Tx
## Analgesia
### [[NSAIDs|NSAID]] first line
### Chronic pain clinic referral 
## Hormonal therapy
### [[OCP]], [[IUD]] or [[GnRH analogue]]
## Consider surgery

---
## Complications
### Constant bleeding -> [[Iron deficiency]] and [[Anaemia]]
### Major psychiatric comorbidity -> [[Major depressive disorder]], [[Anxiety disorders]]
### If pregnant -> increases the risk of certain obstetric complications:
#### [[Ectopic pregnancy]]
#### [[Very preterm babies]] and [[Recurrent miscarriages]]
#### [[Placenta previa]]

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### Implantation of tissues provoking oestrogen dependent chronic inflammation 
### Retrograde migration of endometrial tissue and seeding into extra-uterine sites:
#### Intrapelvic endometriosis
##### Ovarian endometriomas
##### Superficial peritoneal -> may progress into deep infiltrating endometriosis
What may starts as vague low abdominal pain which may be attributed to particularly bad and debilitating periods ([[Dysmenorrhea]]) -> progresses towards organ specific symptoms as the endometrial tissue infiltrates:
- Ectopic uterine sites -> [[Menorrhagia HMB]]
- Vagina -> [[Dyspareunia]]
- Urinary tract -> [[Haematuria]] which will get much worse during periods, [[Dysuria]] and [[Irritative storage symptoms]]
- Rectum -> [[Catamenial haematochezia]]
#### Extrapelvic endometriosis
##### Most commonly to diaphragm, lung and pleura -> [[Catamenial haemoptysis]]
##### Others include -> Catamenial [[Sciatica]]
