Aliases: Akinetic crisis

# 
## Clinical features:
### Often in those with established PD
### A milder form can occur in those with first presentation of PD
#### Leg's giving out -> legs are weak -> canno't stop themselve's walking downhill 
## DDx:
### Secondary to sudden deprivation of dopamine -> often caused by removal of [[levo-DOPA|Levo-DOPA]] tx in someone with [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]]
### Could be iatrogenic or just stomach flu -> [[Gastroenteritis]]
### Can be the first presentation of akinetic-ridged syndrome variant of PD 
## Mimics:
### Looks similar to Neuroleptic malignant syndrome but instead occurs suddenly  
## Workup:
### ___ diagnosis
---
# Tx
## Subcut Apomorphine injections with Domperidone for nausea
## If the mild form -> [[MAO-b inhibitor|Selegiline]]

# Never suddenly stop PD meds
## Clinical features:
### Often in those with established PD
### A milder form can occur in those with first presentation of PD
#### Leg's giving out -> legs are weak -> canno't stop themselve's walking downhill 
### Tetrad of signs also seen in neuroleptic malignant syndrome
#### Fever -> [[Hyperpyrexia]]
#### Confusion
#### Generalised [[Lead-pipe rigidity]] 
#### Autonomic instability leading to derranged vitals -> Generalised [[Hyperhydrosis|Diaphoresis]], Sinus tachycardia, tachypnoea and [[Labile blood pressure]]
## DDx:
### Secondary to sudden deprivation of dopamine -> often caused by removal of [[levo-DOPA|Levo-DOPA]] tx in someone with [[Idiopathic parkinson disease]]
### Could be iatrogenic or just precipitated by stomach flu -> [[Gastroenteritis]]
### Can be the first presentation of akinetic-ridged syndrome variant of PD 
## Mimics:
### Looks similar/identical to [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] but instead occurs suddenly  
## Workup:
### Labs
#### Increased serum CK
#### [[Generalised leucocytosis]]

---
# Tx
## Subcut Apomorphine injections with Domperidone for nausea
## If the mild form -> [[MAO-b inhibitor|Selegiline]]

---
## Complications
### [[Rhabdomyolysis]] -> [[AKI]]
### [[Aspiration]]

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### Essentially identical to [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] -> acute reduction in central dopamine transmissio
