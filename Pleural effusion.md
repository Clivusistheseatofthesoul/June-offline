# Increased fluid in the pleural space (between ribcage and the lung)
## Clinical features:
###
## DDx:
### Transudate (watery) -> capillary filtration barrier intact
#### Loss of pleural oncotic pressure
##### Nephrosis -> [[Nephrotic syndrome]]
##### Cirrhosis -> [[Chronic liver disease]]
##### Gastrosis -> [[protein losing enteropathy]]
#### Increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure
##### [[CCF]], [[Left heart failure]] causing [[Pulmonary congestion]]
### Exudate (cellularly) -> inflammation causing increased permeabiltiy
#### Neoplastic and paraneoplastic
#### [[Tuberculosis]]
#### Secondary to infection/[[Pneumonia]]
## Mimics:
###
## Workup: ^6e6419
### lat decubital CXR
#### Initial gathering of fluid once > 250mL will blunt the costophrenic angle
#### Fluid level with meniscus is indicative of some form of fluid gathering in the pleural space
##### Could still be haemothorax, chylothorax or just an effusion 
### If the fluid is septated and lobulated -> loculated effusions -> aggressive therapeautic drainage
#### Chest drain (Thoracostomy) +/- intrapleural enzyme therapy (alteplase and dornase alfa) -> save some of the fluid for analysis
#### If that still fails -> Thoracotomy debridement
### If non-loculated fluid and has CCF -> probably caused by CCF -> go straight to diuresis
### If non-loculated fluid + no CHF or the diuresis fails -> Thoracentesis and tap the fluid -> pleural fluid analysis
#### 4 tubes
> 1. Cell count with diff
> 2. Cytology 
> 3. Fun bottle -> TP and LDH, Ada (for TB), TAGs (for chylothorax)
> 4. Cultures -> Gram stain + culture
### Any one of the following light's criteria satisfied dictates the fluid is an **exudate**:
> 1. 	Fluid LDH > 0.66 ULN 
> 2. 	Fluid LDH : serum LDH > 0.6
> 3. 	Total fluid protein : total serum protein > 0.5

### All of the following light's criteria must be **negative** to dictate the fluid is a **transudate**:
> 1. 	Fluid LDH > 0.66 ULN 
> 2. 	Fluid LDH : serum LDH > 0.6
> 3. 	Total fluid protein : total serum protein > 0.5

# Tx
## If associated with pneumonia -> parapneumonic effusion
### If small -> no change in abx -> moniter to ensure it does not progress -> review 
### If large -> admit + pleural tap and culture before you start IV abx
#### If Mild-moderate CAP source -> IV 1.2g benzylpenicillin q6hrs + IV 500mg metronidazole q12hrs 
#### If severe CAP source -> IV 2g ceftriaxone 
#### If severe HAP or VAP source -> IV 4g-0.5g pip-tazo q6hr

## Complications
### Becomes innoculated and infected -> [[Pleural empyema]]
