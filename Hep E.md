# Summary
-   Escherichia coli is a normal component of the gut flora
    -   Initially, overwhelming expansion can cause diarrhoea with O157:H7 EHEC causing severe, haemorrhaagic and watery diarrhoea + Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
    -   when given the opportunity for expansion it can invade into surrounding mucosal and epidermal surfaces causing → UTI, Ascending cholangitis → eventually to distant organs which are **life-threatening** → Neonatal meningitis
    -   HepE is a RNA virus with open reading frame
		-   Does not intergrate into the genome of the host cell -> easier to eliminate and treat 
	
# Aetiology
## Spread
### Faecal-oral spread
#### Common in outbreaks near watersources, and meat sources 
## Pathogenicity

---
# Clinical manifestations
## Only causes [[Acute hepatitis]] -> [[Chronic hepatitis]] only if [[Immunocompromised patient]]
### However in the Pregnant it does cause -> [[Fulminant hepatic failure]]

---
# Dx
## IgM to diagnose current or recent infection
## IgG stays for life -> demonstrate previous infection 

---
# Tx 
## Chronic hepatitis can be controlled with riboflavin
## Primary prevention with HepE vaccine.... which is locked up by China lol
