# Physical new mass within the intracranial cavity 
## Clinical features:
### [[Raised ICP]], Compression of surroundings resulting in activating lesions ([[Seizures]]) and destructive lesions [[FND]]
## DDx:
### Trauma and vascular -> [[Ischaemic stroke]], [[Intracranial haemorrhage]]
### Neoplastic -> divided into Infiltrating and displacing tumours -> [[Intracranial neoplasm]]
|               | Displacing                                                 | Infiltrating                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Presentation  | Seizures, raised ICP headache, obvious FND                 | Seizures, diffuse FND            |
| Imaging at Px | Small lesion with defined border                           | Large lesion with diffuse border |
| Aetiology     | Extra-CNS cell-line origin E.g Mets, Meningioma, Ependyoma | Primary CNS tumours, NCC derivatives ([[Melanoma]])                                 |
		
### Infectious -> [[Neurocysticercosis]], [[Intracranial abscess]]
## Mimics:
### [[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension]]
## Workup:
### Supportive history and exam
### Formal diagnosis is by imaging -> CT -> MRI 
### Certain mass lesions may require aspiration/bx to elucidate aetiology
