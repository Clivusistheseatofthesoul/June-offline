# [[Autoimmune encephalitis]] specifically targetting the MTL (limbic encephalitis)
## Clinical features: Produces a limbic encephalitis
### No psychiatric history -> presenting with acute-subacute onset confusion
#### Oftentimes earlier they can have a [[RBD]] and other sleep disturbances
### Resistant and progressive to anti-psychotics -> Worsening cognitive deficit + [[Seizures]] and specifically [[Faciobracial dystonic seizures]] are pathognomonic
#### Othertimes can get [[Cognitive seizure]] in around 65%
#### Oftentimes cognitive deficits -> in over 90% (particularly amnesia, verbal and visuospatial domains) 
### Later features also -> [[Autonomic failure]] -> derranged BP and HR
## DDx:
### Autoimmune
### Paroneoplastic only in 5-10% -> thymoma
## Mimics:
### Subacute course of encephalitis of infectious aetiology
## Workup:
### Serum electrolytes reveals refractory [[Hyponatraemia]] from hypothalamic mediated [[SIADH]]
### LP -> CSF study with viral serology -> takes 1 week to return -> start IV acyclovir if high suspicion
### EEG -> encephalitis have an abnormal EEG as opposed to Schizophrenia
---
# Tx
See [[Autoimmune encephalitis#Treatment is often the same between the different subtypes|General treatment for autoimmune encephalitis]]
## Acute immunosuppression
### Plasma exchange, intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) or high-dose IV corticosteroids are often used in concert
### If refractory -> B cell blockade -> [[Rituximab]]
## Systemic search for tumor + resection
---
## Complications
### Relapse in up to 35%
### Permenant MTL sclerosis and hippocampal atrophy
#### Permemnant cognitive and amnestic disability

---
## Aetiology
## Pathophysiology
### NMDA antagonism in the thalamus -> disinhibition of the frontal cortex
---
#### Cases
Ms AY is a 28F psychiatric inpatient whom is asked for a consult for a first seizure on a background of new onset psychosis. There is no history of psychiatric disease, this is her first psychotic episode and it occured on a context of "the flu" occuring a few weeks before onset of a paranoid psychosis. The psychosis was accompanied by abnormal mouth and tongue movements. Anti-psychotics reduced her auditory hallucinations; however, her cognition is progressively worsening and she is now hypersomnolent. On entering the room, the patient was sleeping and only rousable with painful peripheral stimulus. She is confused and does not participate for a formal neurologic examination. She has dyskinetic movements of the mouth and tongue. Her BP and pulse fluctuate wildly.
