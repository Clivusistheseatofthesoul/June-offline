# Classically deeper breaths at normal rate
## Description:
### Initially rapid shallow breaths → may progress to become unusually deeper and 'air hungry' at normal or increased rate 
## DDx 
### Any cause of [[Metabolic acidosis]] will induce severe hyperventilation → Kussmaul's respirations
#### [[HAGMA]]
#### [[NAGMA]]

## 
**Mechanism:** Any form of acidosis E.g Severe ketoacidosis → increased serum and CSF [H+] → pontine respiratory centre activation → hyperventilation to reduce pCO2 → severe hyperventilation as respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis → Kussmaul breathing
