#### Bipolar II and cyclothymia must be ruled out
### Labs
#### Urine drug screen -> esp. for stimulants
##### Cocaine, amphetamines, prescription amphetamines, Betel nut

# Acute Tx
## Manic phase in ED
### [[Benzos]] ± anti-psychotic (typically [[Quetiapine]])
### Indications for admission
#### Acute mania which will harm their own reputation, damage their social relationships
#### Acute mania with significant psychotic features
### Behavioral interventions
#### Limit setting
#### Reduce stimulation 
#### Restore circadian rhythm
## Depressed phase (bipolar depression)
### [[Quetiapine]] monotherapy sometimes used
### Anti-depressant + Mood stabaliser ± anti-psychotic (typically [[Quetiapine]])
### Anti-depressant must be opposed by a stabaliser or anti-psychotic
#### [[Lithium]] is first line but has lots of side effects
#### [[Valporate]] is your second line

# Maintaince Tx
## Maintainence phase aims for secondary prevention
### [[Mood stabaliser]] monotherapy
#### [[Atypical anti-psychotics]] like [[Olanzapine]]; or [[Lithium]] if mania dominant
#### [[Quetiapine]] if equipolar
#### [[Lamotrigine]] if depression dominant
### Combination Mood stabaliser ± adjunct 
#### Preferably Li or valporate
#### Adjunct of:
##### anti-psychotic (typically [[Quetiapine]] or [[Aripiprazole]]) -> but goal is to wean down to monotherapy

#### May need anti-psychotic (Esp. [[Risperidone]]) if mania predominant
#### May need [[lamotrigine]] if depression dominant
### Aims for maintainence of euthymia and prevention of relapse
#### Psychological intervention battery of *PEACE*
##### Psychoeducation
##### Early warning signs
##### Access to treatment should warning signs appear
##### Circadian rhythms (interpersonal social rhythm therapy) and CBT (esp. for depressive symptoms)
##### Evaluate symptoms and side effects of Tx
### If monotherapy or combination not effective
#### ECT
#### TMS
#### Adjunct with modafinil, thyroxine

---
## Complications
### Remain manic internally and cease external expression -> [[Catatonia]] -> [[Malignant catatonia]]
### Post-[[Mania|manic phase]] -> Post-manic [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]]
#### Can use anti-depressant only if opposed by something else; NEVER use unopposed anti-depressant in bipolar disease
