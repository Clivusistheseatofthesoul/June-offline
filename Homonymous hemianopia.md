#  Loss of conscious vision for the contralateral hemifield -> bump into things **on one side**
## Two types:
### [[Homonymous hemianopia w macular sparing| With macular sparing]] and [[Homonymous hemipanopia with macular splitting| With macular splitting]]
### If defects different in either eye but still respecting vertical meridian -> [[Incongruous homonymous hemianopia]]

Sometimes patients with homonymous hemianopias insist they are blind in one eye -> may attempt to get glasse to improve to no avail
- they will present with bumping into objects all on one side of the patient 
- they will present with inability to read:
	- Left sided hemianopia -> cannot find the start of the next line
	- Right sided hemianopia -> cannot find the next word in the line -> cant read at all

> If they are aware of the visual defect to one side -> it is more likely a macular-splitting homonymous hemianopia -> as macular sparing hemianopias will preserve central vision
