# Unsteady and staggering gait (titubations with instability which worsens when walking tandem) which is usually compensated by broadening of the base
## Includes:
### [[Broad-based gait]], difficulty with tandem gait, [[Titubations (truncal ataxia)]]
## Part of:
### [[Cerebellar ataxia]], [[Sensory ataxia]], [[Vestibular ataxia]]

---
**Mechanism:** Lesion of any of the pathways into and including the cerebellar vermis. E.g cerebellar lesion, vestibular system lesion, proprioceptive system (dorsal column or spinocerebellar tract) lesion
**Seen in:** #Neuro

Typically gait ataxia refers to the gait seen classically from cerebellar ataxia

- The disequilibrium is compensated by broadening of the base → broad based gait
- There is often titubations → anterior-posterior plane truncal movements around 3-5Hz → referred to as → truncal ataxia
- Instability and proneness to falls is low when given freedom to use broad-based gait but is revealed when walking tandem.
    - Walking tandem exacerbates lesions most when done **slowly.**
    - Psychogenic gait ataxia often has worsened titubations when walking fast instead of slow!
