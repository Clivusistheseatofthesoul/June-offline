Mechanism: Destructive lesion to the #bilateral #MLF found in the  ___ . MLF  is a highly myelinated pathway which connects the abducens nucleus to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus to allow for conjugate lateral gaze. Demyelination or ischaemic damage MLF (named by the side with oculomotor nucleus) results in inability of that oculomotor nucleus to follow the contralateral lateral gaze â†’ failure to adduct
Seen in: #Neuro #autoimmune #Ischaemia
